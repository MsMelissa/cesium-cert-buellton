RE: ARCO - 653 AoF Design Review Submittal last Dated October 18, 2024 
 
To Whom It May Concern, 
 
This letter summarizes the remaining outstanding design review comments for the proposed ARCO development located at 653 Avenue of Flags. This project has undergone multiple design review submissions, with the most recent submittal dated October 18, 2024. 
 
The latest submission remains largely unchanged from the previous version, with several key design review comments still not fully addressed. The primary concern is the lack of coordination between the drawings, which may impact the building’s exterior appearance—a matter of significance to the Planning Commission. While it is understood that design details need not be finalized at the planning stage, the drawings should be sufficiently developed to ensure the proposed exterior design remains consistent throughout the review and approval process. 
 
The following discrepancies have been identified: 
 
• Roof Plan vs. Elevations: The roof plan does not align with the elevations, particularly in relation to the parapet details. 


 
• Wall Section vs. Elevations: The wall section does not adequately depict the required architectural character details, nor does it match the elevations based on the heights provided. For example, the parapet height is shown as 26'-10" in the wall section, whereas the elevations indicate a maximum height of 24'-0", and the roof plan reflects a height of 25'-8". 


 
• Architectural Depth and Detail: The elevations suggest a greater depth at the arch surrounding the entry door than what is shown in the wall section. Additionally, while the parapet step-back depicted in the section provides adequate depth, it does not match the roof plan and does not clarify how the stepped parapet will terminate. The section should illustrate the parapet stepping back in the opposite direction as indicated in the elevations. 


 
Despite these outstanding issues, it is recommended that the project proceed to the Planning Commission Public Hearing. The proposed design generally complies with the Art Deco design guidelines for the Avenue of Flags, and further refinements to address these discrepancies can be incorporated as the project advances. 
 

Respectfully, 
 
 
 
Greg Ravatt, Principal Architect
