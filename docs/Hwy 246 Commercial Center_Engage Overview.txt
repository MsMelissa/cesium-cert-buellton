Hwy 246 Commercial Center
Planning Projects
On behalf of the current property owner Central Holding Group, LLC, Lonnie Roy, ON Design has submitted permit applications and project plans for a new commercial development, Highway 246 Commercial Center located at 20, 26 & 60 E. Highway 246 and 220 Avenue of Flags. The existing buildings on the property, which formerly housed Las Tres Rosas Mexican Restaurant, would be removed and the site is proposed to be redeveloped with the following uses and a total of 35,260 SF of gross building area:
● Two-story motel (24,490 SF), 24 guest units, located on the property's northern frontage on Hwy 246
● Coffee shop with drive through (1770 SF),
● Market/deli (9,000 SF), situated at the southeast corner of the property, includes an adjacent patio space between the building and Zaca Creek.
● 65 parking spaces.
● Remainder of the site: two trash enclosures, parking, pedestrian walkways, Zaca Creek trail and landscape.
The proposed 2-story Motel is shown to be 23 feet 7 inches in height, with architectural projections up to 30 feet. The design style presents as Art Deco-Midcentury Modern, with a secondary theme of space, due to the proximity of Vandenberg Space Force Base. The building appears to be raised out of the floodplain. Further review is needed to verify building heights from finished floor elevation per FEMA requirements.
The proposed Coffee Shop is designed in a 50s Diner style, with iconic pop-art elements that include a large coffee cup above the pickup window and a coffee pot that vehicles drive through to place their orders. Building heights appear to be: 16 feet for main building, 18.5 feet for the coffee cup is 18.5 feet, and 28 feet for the coffee pot. No operator for the business has been identified yet; hours of operation are unknown but anticipated to align with similar coffee shops that are open from 4:30 am to 10 pm. The building is in the flood plain and would have dry flood proofing construction.
The proposed Market is designed as an art deco theater with a central marquee/main entrance facing Highway 246. The predominant building height appears to be 22~ feet, with the center architectural tower element reaching 35 feet. No operator for the business has been identified yet; hours of operation are unknown but anticipated to align with similar markets that are open from 7:00 am to 11 pm. The building is in the flood plain and would have dry flood proofing construction.
