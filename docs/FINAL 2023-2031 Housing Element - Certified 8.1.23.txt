2023-2031 Housing Element 
Executive Summary 
The Housing Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of the General Plan. Buellton’s 2023-2031 Housing Element places housing within the larger goals of the General Plan for economic prosperity, health and equity, environmental sustainability, and quality of life. This Housing Element looks beyond the singular objective of meeting Buellton’s legal obligations for planning for new housing; rather, it aims to create a community with quality, healthy housing that meets the needs of all socioeconomic segments of the community. The Housing Plan in Section B has been prepared to be realistic and achievable based on the capacity of a small City staff to address the identified housing needs in this geographically small and largely built-out City. 
Unlike other elements of the General Plan, the Housing Element is required to be updated every 8 years (planning cycles) to ensure that the needs of the community are regularly reviewed. The City of Buellton adopted its first Housing Element in 1993 with a revision in 2009, and the 5th Cycle update in 2015. This Housing Element update is for the 6th planning cycle that covers the period February 15, 2023 to February 15, 2031. The Housing Element identifies existing housing conditions and community needs, describes where new housing can be developed, establishes goals, and creates a plan for supporting the production of housing to meet the needs of the City’s current and future residents. It includes the following sections: 
A.  Introduction. The Introduction to the 2023-2031 Housing Element summarizes the community profile of Buellton (such as location and population) as well as some of the primary housing issues in Buellton. This section also outlines the purpose of the Housing Element Update as it relates to state legislation and discusses the relationship of the Housing Element to the General Plan. Finally, this section outlines the various ways the public was encouraged to provide input into the drafting of the Housing Element and provides a high-level summary of comments received on the document.  
B.  Housing Plan. This section lists the City of Buellton’s housing goals, policies, programs, and actions for the 6th Cycle that make up its “Housing Plan.” As stated in the Housing Element, goals are aspirational purpose statements that indicate the City’s big-picture direction on housing-related needs. The City’s housing goals are as follows: 
Goal H-1: A diverse community with a broad range of housing types and opportunities to accommodate expected new households. 
Goal H-2:  A city where housing opportunities meet the needs of all socioeconomic segments of the community. 
Goal H-3:  A community that conserves existing housing resources. 
Goal H-4:  A city with an efficient process for improving existing housing and developing new housing. 
Goal H-5:  An equitable community that provides equal housing opportunities to all residents. 
Beneath each goal are policy statements that outline the City’s preferred course of action to achieve that goal, such as modifying the development review process to facilitate housing 
construction. The Housing Element also includes a table of programs and actions that outline specific actionable steps that will be taken over the next 8 years to implement the City’s housing goals and policies. This section also includes a summary of quantified objectives that are estimates of the number of housing units likely to be constructed, rehabilitated, or preserved by income level between 2023 and 2031. 
C.  Housing Needs Assessment. Section C of the Housing Element includes a comprehensive Housing Needs Assessment for Buellton. The section begins with a detailed summary of the City’s population and housing characteristics, especially as they relate to housing needs. Next is the housing profile, which is an assessment of housing needs in Buellton. The Housing Element also addresses that part of the population with special housing needs, including seniors, persons with disabilities, female-headed households, large households, farmworkers, and the homeless. Next is a section on Housing Preservation Needs, which addresses existing assisted housing developments that may change from low-income to market-rate housing in the next 10 years. Finally, this section includes a summary of the AFFH analysis contained in Appendix B of the Housing Element. 
D.  Constraints Analysis. The Constraints Analysis addresses the various governmental, environmental, and market constraints that may hinder the development of housing in the City of Buellton. Governmental constraints encompass policies and regulations that affect residential development and housing affordability including the Zoning Ordinance, the General Plan, development processing procedures and fees, on-site and off-site improvement requirements, and the California Building and Housing Codes. Potential environmental constraints to development in the City of Buellton include flooding, landslides, and wildfire, and market constraints include the cost of land and cost of construction. 
E.  Housing Opportunities and Resources. This section addresses how the City proposes to meet its 6th Cycle Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). RHNA is an assessment of the overall housing needs in a jurisdiction for a particular period, which is assigned by the state through the regional council of governments. Jurisdictions are not required to build the housing units outlined by their RHNA; rather, they must ensure that adequate sites and zoning are in place for the market to produce the identified housing. The current 6th cycle RHNA for the City of Buellton is outlined below.

The Housing Opportunities and Resources section contains an assessment of housing that could be developed in the City over the next 8 years. Included in the assessment are “Credits Toward RHNA,” which include recently built, entitled units pending approval, and Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) that are expected to be built during this period. The next section, the Residential Sites Inventory, then provides a summary of vacant and under-developed land with appropriate land use and zoning designations that will likely be developed with residential development over the next 8 years. A key component of this analysis is the City’s Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ), which allows certain commercial and industrial sites to be developed with housing provided they meet specific affordability requirements. The analysis concluded that the City has more than adequate land to meet the RHNA in all income categories as shown in Table H-2 below.

The Housing Opportunities and Resources section also addresses financial and administrative resources that can be utilized to support the development of housing in the City. 
F.  Evaluation of Accomplishments of 5th Cycle Housing Element. This section provides an assessment of the accomplishments of the City of Buellton’s 5th Cycle Housing Element, which addressed the period from 2015 to 2022. A detailed summary of each 5th Cycle goal is provided together with the specific actions that were identified to implement it. Also included is a summary of the current status of each item together with an assessment of how it has contributed to the supply of special needs housing. 
Appendix A – Public Outreach Materials. Appendix A includes public outreach materials generated during the Housing Element Update process. Included in the Appendix is a Stakeholders List that includes organizations in the City and region that represent low- and moderate-income households, including local churches, agencies, and organizations, such as People Helping People, who provide housing, health and education services for lower income and homeless populations. Also included in Appendix A is the Housing Element Survey that was distributed during the process together with a tabulation of results for each question. The City received a total of 206 responses to the Housing Survey. 
Appendix B – AFFH Analysis. Appendix B includes a comprehensive AFFH Analysis. The analysis describes that Buellton is predominantly Latinx-White and its geography shows a pattern of general integration, without any high concentrations of poverty and affluence that can be a fair housing concern when associated with a single race or ethnic groups. In addition, Buellton offers high opportunity areas but faces some challenges in promoting and providing a range of housing types and prices suitable for lower-income households. The AFFH Analysis also summarizes the following four key fair housing issues in the City of Buellton: 1) Insufficient Outreach and Education on Fair Housing Rights; 2) Housing Disparities for Low-Income Residents, Elderly, and Persons with Disabilities; 3) Displacement Risk for Low-Income Residents; and 4) Substandard Housing Conditions. 
A. Introduction 
The City of Buellton is a California central coast community with a population of approximately 5,200 in the Santa Ynez Valley of Santa Barbara County, approximately midway between Santa Barbara and Santa Maria. Two highways run through the city: U.S. Highway 101, which bisects the city in a north-south direction, and Highway 246 in an east-west direction. Buellton is semi-rural in character, and has a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial uses within its 1.6 square miles. The city is surrounded by equestrian ranches, farms, vineyards, and wineries. With its small-town atmosphere, natural setting on the Santa Ynez River and location beneath the Santa Rita Hills – which is an American Viticultural Area known for its world class grapes, and recent increase in restaurants, breweries, and distilleries – Buellton is increasing in popularity as a vacation destination with a growing hospitality sector. 
From 2010 to 2020 Buellton experienced a growth rate of 6.9% in population and an increase in housing of 10% (U.S. Census). Relatively equal percent changes in population and housing occurred from 2000 through 2010, indicating that Buellton’s housing development has been keeping pace with population growth over those two decades. Furthermore, issues facing other areas of Santa Barbara County, such as overcrowding and maintaining a jobs-housing balance, which are two critical factors in the methodology for determining the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), did not significantly affect this area of the county, resulting in a decrease in the City’s RHNA for the 2023-2031 planning period as compared to the prior RHNA cycle. For the 6th Cycle, Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG) has allocated 165 housing units (55 Very Low income, 37 Low, 30 Moderate, and 43 Above Moderate) that will need to be planned for within the city by 2031 to accommodate anticipated population growth.  
In the first two decades of the 2000s, Buellton made significant gains in meeting lower income housing needs of the community. The City’s 2005 Housing Element called for the establishment of an affordable housing overlay zone (AHOZ) as its principal means of accommodating the City’s regional share of housing needs for persons and families of lower and moderate incomes. The original AHOZ consisted of nine development sites dispersed throughout the city that were zoned for commercial or industrial development. Since its inception through 2022, two sites have been developed with residential projects under the AHOZ ordinance, and produced 106 units, 19 of which are affordable to lower and moderate income levels; two other sites are proposed with AHOZ projects that are in the approval process as of 2022, and anticipated to produce a total of 138 residential units, 100% (excluding a manager’s unit) of which would be affordable; and one site was developed with a commercial use. As of 2022, four sites are available for development, two of which are expected to exceed the City’s RHNA during this planning period (see Figure H-1, Location of AHOZ Sites (2022), in Section D). In addition, the City adopted an inclusionary 
housing ordinance in 2002, with updates in 2006, which has also resulted in steady production of affordable housing units in the city. Both the AHOZ and inclusionary housing programs will be maintained as part of this Housing Element Update.  
Despite this progress in providing affordable housing, Buellton still faces some challenges in housing in 2022. From 2010 to 2020, Buellton’s older population increased, and almost half of its popula-tion is over the age of 45, and 16% of its population is 65 years of age or older. This aging population creates a demand for affordable housing options for seniors, especially to meet their housing challenges. The City approved a 50-unit Village Senior Apartment project during the 2015-2023 Housing Element planning cycle, and there are more opportunities to assess the needs and challenges that older populations are facing in Buellton, which are described in Section B.2, Implementation Programs and Actions.  
Another housing challenge is high housing costs, especially since both the homeownership and rental markets have increased in the city and in the region. These high housing costs make housing unaffordable, especially for low-income residents, creating financially stressful situations. It can also lead to socioeconomic consequences, impacting residents’ social, physical, and mental health, especially for those who live in overcrowded and substandard conditions. These consequences become barriers to opportunities and upward social mobility. According to the latest Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data from the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) agency, 35% of Buellton’s households are cost-burdened (2014-2018). Generally, having older housing stock is one way to provide affordable options for low-income residents as it creates a “trickle-down” situation where older units are more affordable than newer units. In Buellton, almost 70% of the housing units were built before 1990; however, Buellton’s vacancy rate is very low, indicating that there are insufficient housing units to house residents of all income levels. In addition, the lack of affordable housing in surrounding cities has exacerbated the squeeze on Buellton’s housing, as housing prices have risen without substantial reinvestment, and has created situations where current homeowners cannot now afford to purchase their own homes. The challenges described above show that the City may have potential opportunities for neighborhood investment to address their housing challenges.  
This Housing Element places housing within the larger goals of the General Plan for economic prosperity, health and equity, environmental sustainability, and quality of life. This Housing Element looks beyond the singular objective of meeting Buellton’s legal obligations for planning for new housing. This Housing Element aims to create a community with quality, healthy housing that meets the needs of all socioeconomic segments of the community. The Housing Plan in Section B has been prepared to be realistic and achievable based on the capacity of a small City staff to address the identified housing needs in this geographically small and largely built out City. 
1. Purpose and Legal Framework 
This 2023-2031 Housing Element represents the City of Buellton’s effort in fulfilling the requirements under California Housing Element law. The California Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable living environment for every Californian as the state’s major housing goal. Recognizing the important role of local planning and housing programs in the pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities and counties prepare a housing element as part of the comprehensive General Plan.  
Pursuant to state law, the Housing Element must be updated every 8 years according to statutory deadlines. This Housing Element covers the planning period between February 2023 and February 2031. State law requires that the Element include the following components: 
• An analysis of the City’s population, household, and employment base, and the characteristics of the housing stock. 

• A summary of the present and projected housing needs of the City’s households. 

• A review of potential constraints to meeting the City’s identified housing needs. 

• An evaluation of opportunities that will further the development of new housing. 

• A statement of the Housing Plan to address the identified housing needs.  


2. Relationship to the General Plan 
The Housing Element is one of seven mandatory elements of the City’s General Plan, a long-range vision document that provides guidance for future development in Buellton. The City Council adopted the City of Buellton General Plan 2025 in 2007 with specific revisions occurring in the years following. For the General Plan to provide effective guidance on land use issues, the goals, policies, and programs of each element must be internally consistent with other elements. This Housing Element builds upon the existing General Plan and is consistent with its goals and policies. In the event an element of the General Plan is amended, the City will consider the impacts of the amendment on other elements to maintain consistency across all documents. 
Housing policy draws upon the development capacity levels established in the Land Use Element to determine the appropriate location for housing development. One of the General Plan’s primary themes is to facilitate mixed-use development in the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area, as well as facilitate the development of lower and moderate income housing throughout the City in the Affordable Housing Overlay Zone. Concurrent with this Housing Element Update, the City is updating its Land Use and Circulation Elements (LUCE), which will maintain policy direction to accommodate appropriate locations for housing across the city. 
California Government Code §65302(g) and §65302.5 require that, upon the next revision of housing elements after 2014, the Safety Element must be reviewed and updated as necessary to address wildfire risks. Concurrent with the preparation of this Housing Element Update, the City is updating its Safety Element to meet state law. 
Government Code §65302(h) requires local jurisdictions that have disadvantaged communities to incorporate environmental justice policies into their general plans. Environmental justice addresses inequitable exposure to pollutants and other impacts, and the lack of infrastructure and amenities to equitably serve vulnerable populations. “Vulnerable populations” include disadvantaged communities based on geographic, socioeconomic, public health, and environmental hazards criteria. Buellton does not have disadvantaged communities per the definition given in 
Government Code §65302(h)1, and therefore is not required to address environmental justice in this Housing Element. However, the City is still committed to the principles of environmental quality and social equity by increasing access to housing opportunities as described in this Housing Element through the City’s stated goals, policies, and actions. 
1 “Disadvantaged communities” means an area identified by the California Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to §39711 of the Health and Safety Code or an area that is a low-income area that is disproportionately affected by environmental pollution and other hazards that can lead to negative health effects, exposure, or environmental degradation. 
3. Public Engagement 
In preparing the 2023-2031 (6th Cycle) Housing Element, involvement with the community was prioritized to fully understand their values and ideas for the future. Community members and housing interest groups had several opportunities to express their input and weigh in on housing issues. City staff used a variety of outreach methods to be as inclusive as possible in the engagement events and activities. A summary of outreach activities conducted during the planning effort is provided below. All public meetings were promoted and advertised through the City’s Facebook page, the City’s website, the Buellton Buzz, the Housing Element stakeholders contact list, which is included in Appendix A, and to interested individuals who requested to be on the contact list for the Housing Element Update. In addition, Spanish translation services were made available for all public meetings. 
The stakeholders list (Appendix A) includes organizations in the City and region that represent low- and moderate-income households, including local churches, agencies, and organizations, such as People Helping People, who provide housing, health and education services for lower income and homeless populations. The City reached out to the stakeholders to provide information about each phase of the housing element process, including notification of the Housing Survey, invitations to all public meetings, and notifications when drafts of the Housing Element were made available online and at City Hall for public review and comment. In addition, City staff reached out via email to the managers of each of the mobilehome parks in the City to make them aware of the Housing Element Update process. 
Website and Community Housing Survey 
In January 2022, the City launched the Housing Element Update webpage and online Community Housing Survey (in English and Spanish). The website contained educational information about the purpose and process for the Housing Element, project updates, and notices of upcoming opportunities to participate. This included the opportunity to sign up for an email list for future 
updates for the public study sessions and workshops that were planned for community participation. 
The Community Housing Survey resulted in 206 responses. To connect with as many residents of Buellton as possible, the survey was promoted through the City’s Planning Commission and City Council meetings, the City’s Facebook page, the City’s website, the Buellton Buzz, and the Housing Element stakeholders contact list (Appendix A). The survey was open to the public through the Draft Housing Element development process. The responses from a majority of the survey takers show that those with the greatest need for housing in Buellton are young adults, seniors, large families, and homeless persons. The responses also reveal that the community believes there is a deficiency of available and affordable rental housing and would like to see more diversity in affordable for-sale housing.  
A summary of the survey responses is included in Appendix A, and the survey identifies the following primary housing concerns and desires for the City: 
• Difficult to find available and affordable rental housing 

• Difficult to find affordable for sale housing 

• Top three housing issues/priorities identified: • Providing a range of housing types for different income levels and lifestyles 

• Improving the conditions of existing neighborhoods (e.g., streets, sidewalks, lighting, and parks) 

• Improving the conditions of existing housing stock and property maintenance 




• Lack of affordability for lower income families frequently mentioned 

• Desire to maintain community character frequently mentioned 

• Vineyard Village and smaller single-family homes most cited as new housing types that fit Buellton’s character 


These survey results captured the community’s sentiments towards the current housing issues present in Buellton. The City incorporated the data into the overall analysis of the Element and the main concerns of the community were reviewed and addressed in this Housing Element. The responses received from the community resulted in specific emphasis on affordable housing and diversity in future housing types using the City’s Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) and the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan, as described in the Housing Opportunities and Resources section of this Housing Element. The potential housing sites are intended to result in residential development that could house a more diverse workforce, including younger workers, farmworkers, and hospitality service workers, healthcare workers, schoolteachers, firefighters, and other public servants, who are typically renters and earn at or below the moderate level of the area median income (AMI). 
City Council/Planning Commission Study Session 
Public outreach was also conducted by means of study sessions conducted with the Planning Commission and the City Council. On February 23, 2022, City Planning staff and the consultant team held a joint study session with the Planning Commission and the City Council that provided an overview of Housing Element requirements and housing element law, a discussion of the City’s RHNA and potential housing sites to meet the RHNA, and observa-tions from initial analysis and emerging trends based on input received from the Community Housing Survey to date. Members of the City Council and the Planning Commission asked questions about the process and housing element law, and expressed a strong commitment to providing opportunities for housing all members of the community. There were no comments or questions from members of the public. 
After the study session, the study session video was made available on the CityTV video archive at https://cityofbuellton.com/government/cityTV-archive.php and on the Planning Department webpage under the Housing Element section at https://cityofbuellton.com/departments/planning/. The video has received 24 views on YouTube. 
Community Workshop 
On March 2, 2022, a virtual public workshop was conducted on the Housing Element Update. Spanish translation was offered but not requested. The meeting was advertised and promoted at the February 23, 2022 joint City Council/Planning Commission Study Session and on the City’s website and social media platforms, and an invitation flyer was emailed directly to the City’s email list of over 300 residents and interested parties and to the City’s Housing Element stakeholder’s list.  
During the workshop, City staff and the consultant team provided an overview of Housing Element purpose, requirements, process, and a discussion of the City’s RHNA and potential housing sites to meet the RHNA, and observations from initial analysis and emerging trends based on input received from the Community Housing Survey to date. Participants were then encouraged to provide their input on housing issues and needs in Buellton. Three participants attended the workshop, and the workshop was also made available for viewing only on Buellton’s CityTV, a live-stream platform. After the workshop, the workshop video was made available on the CityTV video archive at https://cityofbuellton.com/government/cityTV-archive.php and on the Planning Department webpage under the Housing Element section at https://cityofbuellton.com/departments/planning/. The video has received 7 views on YouTube. 
Questions and discussion during the workshop were focused on: 
• Increasing rental rates in the area  

• RHNA requirements and unfulfilled 5th Cycle RHNA obligations 

• Affordability covenants and how the City’s affordable housing ordinance requires 44 to 55 years of affordability 

• Interest in multi-generation housing • Trends in accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and how many have been built since new laws were put in place to streamline development 

• Interest in mixed-use and mixed-income developments as a promising housing type, where combining affordable units with market rate housing and commercial uses is a good solution, especially in the City’s Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area. 


Public Review Draft Housing Element 
The Draft Housing Element was made available for a 30-day public review at City Hall and on the City’s website from August 11 through September 12, 2022. Notices to inform the public and stakeholders about the availability of the Draft Housing Element were emailed directly to the City’s email list of more than 300 residents and interested parties and to the City’s Housing Element stakeholder’s list. The availability of the Draft Housing Element was also advertised and promoted at the joint City Council/Planning Commission Study Session on August 24, 2022 and on the City’s website and social media platforms. 
The August 24, 2022 study session was held to review the Draft Housing Element prior to its submittal to the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). The Planning Commission and City Council commented favorably on the Draft Housing Element and recommended submittal to HCD for review after close of the public review period and mandatory 10-working day period to respond to public comments. One member of the public representing the local environmental group WE Watch spoke at the public hearing, and also submitted comments in a letter dated September 5, 2022. The comments and questions requested additional clarification on the use of terms, the efficacy of data, and other background data. The Housing Element was clarified where applicable. The questions and comments had no implication on policies, programs, or the overall analysis. 
 
B. Housing Plan 
1. Goals and Policies 
The housing plan of the Housing Element serves as the City’s strategy for addressing its housing needs. This section describes the housing goals, policies, and programs of the Housing Element for the City of Buellton. 
Goals are aspirational purpose statements that indicate the City’s direction on housing-related needs. Each goal encompasses several policies, which are statements that describe the City’s preferred course of action among a range of other options. Each goal also includes programs, which are actionable steps taken to implement the policies and further the City’s progress towards its goals. Some programs contain quantified objectives, which refer to the number of units that are expected to be constructed, preserved, or rehabilitated through the program during the planning period. These quantified objectives represent measurable outcomes that can be used to benchmark the success of each program.  
The City’s housing goals and policies are implemented through its housing programs, which set forth actions the City intends to take through the administration of land use and development controls, the provision of regulatory concessions and incentives, and the utilization of appropriate federal and state financing and subsidy programs when available. As described in the Introduction, the City is small geographically (1.6 square miles) and is largely built out, has a small population (5,200 people), and a small City staff, the programs are tailored to be realistic and feasible to successfully implement local policy and state law for a city of this size. 
Recognizing the potential and actual constraints on the City’s ability to provide affordable housing, the City’s housing program is primarily oriented towards those measures which can be accomplished at the local level. 
a. Adequate Housing Sites 
Goal H-1: A diverse community with a broad range of housing types and opportunities to accommodate expected new households. 
Policy H-1.1:  Maintain the inventory and development capacity of residential property through zoning designations, density bonuses, modification of development standards, and discouraging the conversion or downzoning of existing land currently designated for residential use. As needed to replenish residential capacity, identify other locations to re-designate for residential. 
Policy H-1.2:  Implement smart growth principles and promote mixed-use development at identified location in the city, with particular focus along Avenue of Flags. 
Policy H-1.3:  Promote integration of all economic population segments in each residential project; however, economics of scale and management efficiencies require that certain projects are made exclusive to target groups and such concentration shall not be the sole basis of project denial. 
b. Affordable Housing 
Goal H-2: A city where housing opportunities meet the needs of all socioeconomic segments of the community. 
Policy H-2.1:  Continue to implement existing policies, programs, and procedures to facilitate attainment of its allocated share of new construction goals assigned through the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process, with particular emphasis placed on the needs of persons and families of extremely low, very low, and low income. 
Policy H-2.2:  Actively seek and formulate partnerships with for-profit and non-profit developers to produce affordable housing and provide reasonable assistance to support and process project applications to achieve development objectives. 
Policy H-2.3:  Seek state and federal funding to support the development of affordable housing and explore local funding alternatives to complement these efforts, including continued participation in the HOME and CDBG programs administered through the County of Santa Barbara as part of the HOME Consortium and Urban County designation, respectively.  
Policy H-2.4:  Continue to support the Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County in the provision of Section 8 rental assistance and look for ways to promote other affordable housing initiatives (e.g., promote the use of Housing Choice Vouchers for ADU rentals). 
c. Housing Preservation 
Goal H-3: A community that conserves existing housing resources. 
Policy H-3.1:  Promote the cooperative repair, rehabilitation, and improvement of mobilehomes and residential structures that are substandard or in disrepair; blighted conditions and unsafe structures shall be abated, and tenants shall be afforded protections in the event of their displacement.  
Policy H-3.2:  Require replacement of dwellings that are deed restricted as affordable housing or occupied by target income groups and removed from the housing inventory due to demolition or conversion; exceptions shall be granted for owner-occupied dwellings, properties undergoing public nuisance abatement and non-conforming uses. 
Policy H-3.3:  Allow dwellings to be rehabilitated that do not meet current lot size requirements, building setbacks or other development standards, so long as the non-conformity is not increased and there is no threat to public health or safety. 
Policy H-3.4:  Actively monitor all affordable units at risk of conversion and use all reasonable efforts to preserve at-risk dwelling including, but not limited to, direct purchase, mortgage refinancing, non-profit partnership acquisition, co-operative tenant conversion, and similar preservation techniques. 
Policy H-3.5:  Ensure owners of publicly assisted affordable units comply with the noticing requirements of state law prior to conversion.  
Policy H-3.6:  Encourage energy efficient construction in all new and rehabilitated dwelling units in compliance with the California Building Code; new land use patterns resulting from annexation shall encourage energy efficiency; solar access for existing development shall be protected and provided in new development, to the extent feasible. 
d. Remove Constraints 
Goal H-4: A city with an efficient process for improving existing housing and developing new housing. 
Policy H-4.1:  Accommodate the full spectrum of housing types in the City’s land use regulations including, but not limited to, mixed-use developments, high density projects, rental and co-op housing, accessory dwelling units, infill development, and special needs housing (i.e., SROs, group homes, congregate living, and emergency shelters). 
Policy H-4.2:  Periodically evaluate and adjust, if applicable, the City’s regulations, ordinances, and development fees to ensure that they do not unduly constrain housing production; new regulatory proposals shall be evaluated for compliance with this policy in advance of adoption. 
Policy H-4.3: Facilitate development of group homes, congregate care, and independent living units for persons with disabilities. 
Policy H-4.4:  Facilitate development of employee housing and farmworker housing. 
Policy H-4.5:  Maintain the adaptive retrofit permit and universal design programs. The adaptive retrofit permit process shall be streamlined to allow ministerial review. 
e. Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing 

Goal H-5: An equitable community that provides equal housing opportunities to all residents. 
Policy H-5.1:  Provide equal access to sound and affordable housing for all, pursuant to state and federal laws.  
A picture containing sky, building, outdoor, house

Policy H-5.2: Provide a variety of housing to facilitate housing choices. 
Policy H-5.3: Enforce all tenant protection laws and anti-displacement policies.  
Policy H-5.4:  Promote awareness of the California Fair Housing and Employment Act and actively support enforcement of the policies of the State Fair Employment and Housing Commission. 
Policy H-5.5:  Encourage the participation of all citizens of Buellton in the development of housing policies for the City.

Program 7 – Fair Housing 
The City is committed to promoting and providing housing opportunities for all residents through meaningful actions. Housing impediments existing in the City are identified in Section C and in the AFFH analysis included as Appendix B, along with the 2020 Analysis of Impediments of Fair Housing Choice for the County of Santa Barbara HOME Consortium. These analyses provide an assessment of the five main fair housing issue areas: 1) fair housing enforcement and capacity; 2) segregation and integration; 3) racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty (R/ECAPs) and racially concentrated areas of affluence (RCAAs); 4) access to opportunity; and 5) dispropor-tionate housing needs and displacement risk. Please note, the summary of fair housing issues below is reflected from the limited available data for the City of Buellton since the city is approximately 1.6 square miles and the city boundary line fits within one larger Census Tract and 
overlaps three Census Block Groups. These Census data also expand into the unincorporated regions surrounding the city. Data from the City, such as District demographic data and surveys, and local knowledge were also used to consider the existing fair housing issues of the City.

In summary, the City of Buellton offers high opportunity areas, which are defined by the state as places that currently have strong economic, environmental, and educational outcomes, but face challenges in providing a range of housing types and prices suitable for lower-income households. Providing a range of affordable housing can help foster more inclusive communities and increase access to opportunities for low-income persons, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and other protected classes. In addition, as shown in the AFFH analysis in Appendix B, Buellton is predominantly Latinx-White and its geography shows a pattern of general integration. In other words, there are no high concentrations of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or having a disability or a particular type of disability. Moreover, there are no significant racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty (R/ECAPs) as well as no racially concentrated areas of affluence (RCAAs). Although there are no R/ECAPs and RCAAs in Buellton, the goals outlined in the table below that address the other three fair housing issue categories, along with the previous programs that promote affordable housing development, contribute to further addressing the fair housing issue areas that exist in the city. 
The table below summarizes fair housing issues, priority rank, contributing factors, goals to address issues, specific commitments to the program, time frame, and metrics the City will use to achieve the goals. High Priority ranks are those that have a direct and substantial impact on fair housing and are core municipal functions that the City can control; Medium Priority ranks are those that have a direct and substantial impact on fair housing, but the City has limited capacity to control their implementation; Low Priority ranks may have a direct and substantial impact on fair housing choice, but the City lacks capacity to address it, or the factor may have only a slight or indirect impact on fair housing choice. The actions listed below, along with the programs above, are designed to cumulatively contribute to AFFH goals.

3. Summary of Quantified Objectives 
The state requires that the Housing Element include an assessment of quantified objectives during the 6th Cycle planning period. Quantified objectives are estimates of the number of housing units likely to be constructed, rehabilitated, or preserved by income level between 2023 and 2031. Estimates are based on the trends, goals, policies, and objectives outlined throughout this Housing Element and may differ from the City’s RHNA requirement. They represent the City’s best assessment of what is likely to be built, rehabilitated, and preserved during the planning period based on needs, resources, and constraints. 
For the purpose of estimating new units that could be constructed between 2023 and 2031, a conservative estimate of 322 new units that could be constructed was used, which assumes approximately 40% of the units anticipated during the planning period by pending Pipeline Projects, ADUs, AHOZ sites, and vacant residential sites.  
Table H-3 below summarizes the City’s Quantified Objectives for the 2023-2031 planning period.

C. Housing Needs Assessment 
1. Population Characteristics 
Considering the characteristics of Buellton helps inform the planning process and establish policies to meet current and future needs of the City. This section examines general population and housing characteristics and trends, such as population growth, age, sex, race and ethnicity, and employment. Characteristics of the existing housing stock, including the number of units and type, age, conditions, housing growth, vacancy, and costs, have also been evaluated to better understand the nature and extent of unmet housing needs in the community. 
Table H-4 below shows population changes of cities in Santa Barbara County from three decennial censuses. Buellton’s population has seen an increase of 26.1% (or 1,000 individuals) from 2000 to 2010 and an increase of almost 7% or 333 individuals from 2010 to 2020. In comparing 2010 and 2020 population numbers, Solvang, a city immediately to the east of Buellton, had the highest population growth, at almost 17% or 881 individuals added. Cities nearby, like Lompoc, which is about 20 miles to the west of Buellton, had a population increase of approximately 14%, the second largest growth after Solvang. Lastly, Santa Maria, a city about 30 miles northwest of Buellton, and Goleta, another city about 30 miles southeast of Buellton, have population increases of 10% and 9%, respectively.

Education 
The education level of Buellton residents is slightly higher than that of the county residents (Table H-8 below). Specifically, 80.9% of the county’s population has graduated from high school or higher, compared to 88.5% citywide. Approximately 34.2% of the county population has a bachelor’s or higher degree, compared to 39.9% citywide. The percentage of individuals with graduate degrees in the city was similar to the countywide statistic, with 14.2% for the city and 14.0% countywide. A higher education level in a population typically translates into greater income-earning potential.

The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Santa Barbara County decreased to 3.9% in December 2021, from a rate of 7.3% one year prior, according to the California Employment Development Department. The unemployment rate decrease could be attributed to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the leisure and hospitality industry showing a great gain in jobs.

Housing Type and Supply 
The 2015-2019 ACS estimates that 2,013 dwelling units existed in the city in 2019, of which 1,941 units are occupied. Single-family units accounted for 74.6% of all units, and multi-family units represented 11.0% of the total. Mobilehome units represented 14.4% of the total housing stock in 2019. The percentage of single-family units was higher than that for either the state or the county in 2019. The 2020 Census count of 2,030 dwelling units differs slightly from the 2015-2019 ACS estimates. In addition, the Planning Department has calculated that as of December 31, 2020, there are a total of 883 multi-family units and 1,242 single-family units, a total of 2,125 housing units.  
Overcrowding 
The HCD defines overcrowding as housing units occupied by more than one person per room in a dwelling unit, excluding kitchen and bathrooms. According to the 2015-2019 ACS data, over-crowded households represented almost 1.2% of all owner-occupied households (16 households) and almost 13% of renter households (76 households) in Buellton. Combined, 4.7% of all 1,941 households (or 92 households in total) are overcrowded compared with 10.7% of all households in Santa Barbara County.  
Substandard Conditions 
The U.S. Census looks at two types of substandard housing problems: 1) households without hot and cold piped water, a flush toilet, and a bathtub or shower; and 2) households with kitchen facilities that lack a sink with piped water, a range or stove, or a refrigerator. These definitions look at what is included inside a housing unit, not outside. 
The 2015-2019 ACS data includes information about some of the factors that may result in substandard housing, such as lack of plumbing facilities and lack of complete kitchen facilities. Of the estimated 1,941 total occupied housing units in the city, an estimated 43 units lack complete kitchen facilities. In addition, HUD’s 2014-2018 CHAS data tracks four severe housing problems: incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more than one person per room, and cost burden greater than 50%. The data showed that 21.6% (405) of the 1,870 total households in the city have at least one of the four housing problems. 
The estimates noted here have large margin of error. For instance, the 2015-2019 ACS estimates that 43 units lack a complete kitchen, but the margin of error for this figure is “±65,” which could mean that the estimate is anywhere between -22 and 108 units that lack a complete kitchen. Since these data do not provide accurate information, the City has additional data and local information on the City’s housing conditions: 
1. The City conducted its own independent field survey in July 2014 to determine housing units needing repair. This survey was published in Buellton’s 5th Housing Element, and found that 14 units have “deferred maintenance” condition and 2 units are in “moderate disrepair” condition. These 16 units represent close to 1% of the 1,856 total units counted in 2014.  

2. The City has two mobilehome parks that comprise approximately 419 units. Based on information from on-site resident managers, it is estimated that 30 to 50 mobilehomes are in need of major repair. 

3. A survey conducted in 2020 on people living in motels (or SROs) along the Avenue of Flags, some of which are legal nonconforming SROs, gathered that 8 out of the 42 households surveyed lacked a complete kitchen. More information on this survey is available in Appendix B (Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Analysis). 


Housing Growth 
In looking at the housing growth rate, especially when comparing it with population change, it is helpful to determine if housing needs are being met. As shown in Table H-4 above, Buellton’s population change from 2000 to 2010 (26.1%) was greater than the population change between 2010 and 2020 (6.9%). Table H-10 below shows the number of housing units. For the City of Buellton, the housing growth rate between 2000 and 2010 was greater (23.9%) than the growth rate between 2010 and 2020 (10.0%). Thus, the housing growth rates are close to the population change between the Censuses, indicating that the City’s housing growth has been likely meeting the housing 
demands due to population growth. Buellton’s housing growth rates were higher than the housing growth rates of Santa Barbara County and California from 2000 to 2020.

Vacancy 
The residential vacancy rate, which translates the number of unoccupied housing units on the market, is a good indicator of the balance between housing supply and demand. A low vacancy rate translates to the demand for housing exceeding the available supply of housing. The 2015-2019 ACS reported that the city had a vacancy rate, for both homeowner and rental, at 0.0% (see Table H-11 below), even though it is estimated that 3.6% of all housing units were vacant, which likely means that vacant homes were seasonally occupied. For 2011-2015 ACS, the homeowner vacancy rate was 2.1% for the city, and the rental vacancy rate was 0.0%. These figures are much lower than the countywide rate and the state rate. The City’s figures are also below the industry standards of optimum rates (2% to 3% for ownership housing and 5% to 6% for rental housing).

Housing Costs and Affordability 
According to the 2015-2019 ACS, the median home value in Buellton was $522,900 in 2019, which was 10.4% greater than the median home value for the County of Santa Barbara and 3.5% greater than the state median value. Similarly, the median gross rent of $1,760 for rental units in the city in 2019 was greater than median gross rents of $1,643 and $1,503 for the county and the state, respectively. According to Zumper.com the average rent for a 1-bedroom in 2022 in Buellton was $2,195. From 2021 to 2022, home values have increased 23.7%, with single-family detached housing sales averaging approximately $811,562 in January 2022, according to Zillow.com.  
Housing prices tend to vary by several factors, such as property type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, year built, and location of the house. According to Redfin.com, 102 housing units were sold in the year 2021. These units consisted of condos, mobilehomes, townhouses, and single-family homes. Almost half (48) of these housing units were single-family homes, most of them included at least 3 bedrooms and 2 baths and were built between the late 1970s and early 2000s. The average price for these homes was approximately $807,000, with a range between $569,000 and $1,325,000. The higher priced single-family homes tended to be located on the west side of Buellton, and the lower priced homes tend to be concentrated in the center of Buellton, closer to the freeways. Mobilehomes have been sold at affordable prices ranging from $125,000 to $300,000 
and most included 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Most of the 22 condos sold in 2021 were concentrated on the east of U.S. Highway 101, ranging from $475,000 to $865,000. Finally, 16 townhomes located on the east and north of central Buellton were sold in 2021, with a range from $498,000 to $825,000, most of them consisting of 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Overall, the average price of all these homes sold in 2021 averaged $646,000. 
Commensurate with overall trends statewide in the real estate market, the long-term rise in the values of existing City residences has precluded the creation of a local “trickle-down” situation wherein housing becomes affordable due to its age. Indeed, increasing valuations have led to situations in which current homeowners could not now afford to purchase their own homes. 
3. Household Profile 
This section provides an assessment of existing housing needs in Buellton. While Buellton residents are generally adequately housed and the local housing stock is in good condition, the City must consider existing and projected needs in its housing plans. These needs include:  
1. Housing need resulting from housing cost burden or overpayment;  
2. Housing needs of special needs groups such as elderly persons, large households, persons with disabilities, female-headed households, homeless persons, farmworkers, and college students; and  
3. Fair housing issues. 
Each of these subjects is discussed below. 
Household Income 
Household income data assists the City in determining its affordable housing needs, based on the income of the existing population. As seen in Table H-12 below, approximately 10.4% of households had annual incomes below $25,000, while 45.8% had incomes of $100,000 or more. The city’s median household income was $93,099 in 2019. The median household income for the city was approximately 20% more than the statewide figure of $75,235.

The extremely-low-income (ELI) households are the most vulnerable group. As shown in Table H-16, 50% of households (75 households) in this income group experienced one or more housing problems, compared to 33.7% (655 households) of all households citywide. Table H-16 also shows that all lower income households who are renters (100% of lower income households or 60 households total) are facing with housing problems, compared to 16.6% of lower income owners. More importantly, as shown in Table H-17, severe housing cost burden (spending half of the household income on housing) impacted 50% (75 households) of the extremely-low-income 
households, compared to 31.1% (605 households) of all households citywide. Table H-17 also showed that 80% of all lower income households who are cost-burdened are renters.  Households with severe cost burdens are most at risk of becoming homeless and most ELI households are likely to be seniors and disabled.

Responding to the needs of ELI households requires a diverse strategy focusing on housing production, preservation, and rental assistance (as described in Program 7). Furthermore, the City commits to the following: 1) encourage the production of accessory dwellings, the majority of which are affordable to ELI, very low, and low-income households (Program 2); 2) facilitate in the development of affordable units, especially units for ELI households (Program 4.a); 3) seek to rehab and preserve existing multi-family projects that are affordable to low income, including ELI, households (Program 5); and, 4) support and publicize the County’s voucher program, which offers vouchers to ELI and low income households (Program 7c).  
Household Size 
The city’s average household size of 2.62 persons (in 2019) is smaller than both the county (2.91 persons) and state (2.95 persons) averages. The percentage of large households (5 or more persons) is greater than the county’s percentage among owner tenures. There are total of 177 large households in Buellton, 117 (66.1%) are owners, while the rest are renter households. Out of the 1,941 households, which includes owners and renters, 71% are households with 2 to 4 persons. 
Tenure 
Housing security can depend heavily on housing tenure, i.e., whether homes are owned or rented. As seen in Table H-9 above, Buellton’s housing stock consists of 2,013 total units, 1,356 (69.9%) of which are owner occupied and 585 (30.1%) of which are renter occupied. The share of renters in Buellton is smaller than the county overall, where 52.1% of total households are renter occupied and 47.9% are renter occupied.  
In many places, housing tenure varies substantially based on the age of the householder. In Buellton, homeowners age 65 and above make up nearly 39.6% of all owner-households. 
Housing Cost Burden 
Housing is generally the largest single expense item for most households. Housing is considered affordable whenever a household spends 30% or less of its household income for shelter. Gross rent or gross monthly owner costs determine a household’s monthly payment for shelter. Gross rent includes the contract rent plus utilities. In most cases, the contract rent includes payment for water, sewer, and trash collection. Gross monthly owner costs include mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, utilities, condominium fees, and site rent for mobile homes.  
According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) 2014-2018 data, an estimated 664 households (35.5%) out of a total of 1,870 households within the city are cost burdened or are overpaying for housing, of which 264 households are extremely cost burdened. Of the total number of households, 530 are renters (with 89 extremely cost burdened) and 1,345 are homeowners (with 175 extremely cost burdened). Additional CHAS data showing “Income by Cost Burden” indicates that 660 lower-income households, both renters and owners, are cost-burdened. This leaves a disproportionate share of their monthly income available for other necessities such as food, medicine, and transportation. Moderate- and upper-income households may, and often do, expend more that 30% of their incomes on housing without experiencing hardships. However, this limitation on housing expenditures is critical to lower-income households because of the very limited and sometimes fixed nature of their incomes.  
As defined by the HCD, a lower-income household is a household whose annual income is equal to or less than 80% of the county’s median household income. Moderate-income equals 80% to 120% of the county’s median household income. While these thresholds vary with household size, the current (2021) upper limits for low- and moderate-income households are shown in Table H-18, based on the Santa Barbara County area median annual income of $100,100 for a family of four. For a point of reference, nearby Ventura County has a median income of $115,400 for a family of four.

As stated above, federal and state agencies regard 30% of gross annual income as a reasonable expenditure for housing. Based on this guideline, the maximum unit price affordable to these income groups can be estimated (assuming a 2.7% interest rate loan for a fixed term of 30 years with a 10% down payment). The same approach can be used to determine maximum monthly rents affordable to each group (which is also equal to the maximum monthly payment affordable to purchase a unit). Using this approach, the upper limits of purchase and rental housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households in the City of Buellton have been determined and are shown in Table H-19.

Based on these housing cost limits and the housing prices, some housing units in Buellton are available for purchase at prices that are affordable to at least low income and moderate-income households. 
Table H-20 below is a breakdown of households by tenure (owner and renter occupied), race or ethnicity, and cost burden (or housing overpayment) for Buellton and Santa Barbara County. Compared to Buellton’s 31.8% of households who are cost burdened, Santa Barbara County has 35.6% of its total households, which is more than the City’s. More owner-occupied households are cost-burdened Countywide (26.9%) compared to the City (18.6%). In addition, the table below shows estimates that Hispanics, Blacks, and another race (“Other”) are cost-burdened at the highest rate. While 18.6% of White owners experience housing cost burdens, HUD CHAS estimates that 50.9% of White renters experience housing cost burdens. To put in context, there are an estimated 1,415 White households and 355 White households are estimated to be experiencing housing cost burden. In addition, according to the 2015-2019 HUD CHAS data, there are 175 
Hispanic households, so this means that about 87 Hispanic households are housing cost-burdened. There are an estimated 10 “Other” households and 15 Black households. While there are an estimated 25 Asians, a small population, the HUD CHAS data estimates there are zero (0) Pacific Islander households in the City.

The following four figures compare overpaying owners by Census Tract using the 2010-2014 and 2015-2019 ACS. The proportion of overpaying owners has remained the same. However, these figures, as similarly stated earlier, are shown at the Census Tract geographic level. As the figures show, the Census Tract where Buellton resides extends beyond the City boundaries. However, these figures show that the Census Tracts surrounding Buellton City have decreased. Countywide, Santa Barbara has seen an estimated increase of households experiencing housing cost burdens near Santa Barbara, the largest City, and along the West coast of the County. 
The data from HUD CHAS data estimates that Buellton’s 31.1% of total households experience housing cost burdens and those affected are among renters, especially among Hispanic, Black, and White households. 
4. Special Housing Needs 
Within the community’s overall estimated housing needs, there are segments of the population that experience special housing needs. These groups include the elderly, the disabled, female-headed households, and the homeless. Such special needs within the City of Buellton are discussed below. 
The County CDBG Urban County partner cities and HOME Consortium members (Buellton is a member of both) set goals for the use of CDBG and HOME funds for special needs housing development through the County’s Consolidated Plan, amended annually by the County’s Action Plan. The Consolidated Plan is adopted every 4 years, the current Plan being for the 2020-2024 period. Similarly, Buellton has also adopted the County’s Phase I and Phase II Community Action Plan to Address Homelessness, which specifically speaks to region-wide collaboration to address homelessness. Buellton is committed to supporting these county-wide efforts and goals, and funding is directed to where it is needed most. If Buellton’s sub-allocation is not used in Buellton, it is directed into the county-wide pot of funds to be used on projects elsewhere in the county. 
Senior Households 
Federal housing data define a household type as “elderly family” if it consists of two persons with either or both age 62 or over. Out of the estimated 1,941 households in Buellton (2019), 174 
households (3.4%) are seniors (65+ years) living alone and 717 households (36.8%) live with at least one senior. These figures are an indication of an increasingly aging population. In addition, 115 of these senior households earn less than $35,000 a year, 3.9% of senior households receive food stamps/SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), 16.1% of seniors are veterans, and 35.1% are seniors with a disability. The fixed or limited nature of their income poses a special problem with regard to housing affordability for the elderly. In addition, the elderly often have special needs in terms of the size, design, and accessibility of housing.  
The Buellton Senior Center provides services, resources, and referrals to seniors in the city. For instance, they have a “Loan Closet” where seniors can borrow basic medical equipment, such as wheelchairs, walkers, and crutches. The Center provides medical patient referrals and transportation, assists seniors with home repairs through administration of the Emergency Mobile Home Repair Program, and helps seniors locate housing opportunities.  
In 2022, the City Council approved plans for the development of Village Senior Apartments, a 50-unit senior housing complex located between Valley Vineyard Townhomes and Village Park, in the Village Specific Plan area.  
The City has included policies and implementation measures that address the housing needs of elderly households in Section B, Housing Plan. 
Persons with Disabilities 
According to the 2015-2019 ACS, there were 557 persons living with disabilities in the City of Buellton which were categorized as follows: independent living, 181; self-care, 47; ambulatory, 207; cognitive, 51; vision, 11; and hearing, 187. Some individuals may experience more than one disability, and some disability types are not recorded for children below the age of 5 years, so citywide totals are not provided.  
State legislation enacted in January 2011 (SB 812) amended state housing element law to require the analysis of the disabled to include an evaluation of the special needs of persons with developmental disabilities. This analysis should include an estimate of the number of persons with developmental disabilities, an assessment of the housing need, and a discussion of potential resources. State law defines “developmental disability” as a severe, chronic disability of an individual that: 
• Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical impairments; 

• Is manifested before the individual attains age 18; 

• Is likely to continue indefinitely; 

• Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency; 

• Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated. 


Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental 
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult. 
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, 4 developmental centers, and 2 community-based facilities. The regional center system was created by the Lanterman Development Disabilities Service Act (Sections 5115 and 5116) of the California Welfare and Institutions Code, which declares that mentally and physically disabled persons are entitled to live in normal residential surroundings.  
The Tri Counties Regional Center (TCRC) provides services to Buellton residents and residents in the counties of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The center is a private, non-profit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.  
The DDS provides a closer look at the disabled population within the only ZIP code area (93427) that encompasses the City of Buellton. This was last updated in January 2022. There are 39 developmentally disabled persons between the ages of 0 and 17 years of age and 17 persons age 18 and above.  
A number of housing types are appropriate for people living with a developmental disability: rent-subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, Housing Choice vouchers, HUD housing, and specialized homes. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this special needs group. Incorporating “barrier-free” design in all new multi-family housing (as required by California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.  
The City does not have HUD subsidized housing projects or specialized homes for persons with disabilities. However, information on programs and services offered, as well as availability of affordable housing units in the city or near Buellton are provided through the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara as well as the United Way of Santa Barbara County.  
To accommodate the needs of disabled persons, the City dedicates funds to an Emergency Mobilehome Repair Program to assist residents in the two senior mobilehome parks with repair projects, including adaptive retrofits, which indirectly assists persons with disabilities. In addition to administering the program, the Buellton Senior Center also supports seniors with disabilities through the provision of medical materials as well as housing assistance and referrals. In addition, the City complies with accessibility requirements under the California Building Code (Municipal Code Sections 19.04.140 and 19.18.026), and the Adaptive Retrofit Permit ordinance which implements provisions of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in all aspects of housing because of a person’s disability (Municipal Code Sections 19.08.160 and 19.16.022).  
Female-Headed Households 
Housing element law requires analysis of specialized housing needs, including female-headed households, in an effort to ensure their housing needs which include affordability, proximity to schools, adequate childcare, public transportation, services, and job training services. Of Buellton’s 1,941 total households, 23.8% are female headed (compared to 27.8% in Santa Barbara County), 5.6% are female headed with children (compared to 5.4% in Santa Barbara County), and 10.9% are female headed households living alone (compared to 15.5% in Santa Barbara County).  
Female-headed households with limited incomes experience difficulty in finding adequate, affordable housing. However, the 2015-2019 ACS estimates that there are zero female-headed households in the city that have incomes below the federally recognized poverty level.  
Resources for lower-income female-headed households can benefit from the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program from the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara and the CalWORKs Child Care Program. In addition, they can benefit from other community and social services provided by non-profit organizations in the regions, such as People Helping People and the Family Strengthening Program at St. Vincent’s Santa Barbara. 
Large Households 
Large households are defined as those with five or more persons. A large household can consist of parents with children and/or extended family members. It can also consist of two or more families sharing the same housing unit or five or more unrelated individuals living together, or a combination of sorts. These large households have special housing needs because of the limited availability of affordable units that can accommodate a large household. Sometimes these large households have lower incomes and reside in smaller units to save on housing costs, which can result in overcrowded living conditions.  
According to the 2015-2019 ACS, of the 1,941 households residing in Buellton in 2019, 177 (9.1%) included five or more persons. In addition, the average household size is 2.62 and the average family size is 2.99, compared to 2.91 and 3.41 for the county, respectively. Moreover, the 2015-2019 ACS reports that approximately 1,357 out of the 2,013 housing units have 4 or more bedrooms; the median number of rooms among the total housing units is 5.2. This shows that about 67% of the housing stock, with four or more bedrooms could reasonably accommodate large families without overcrowding, suggesting that the need for large units is expected to be significantly less than for smaller units.  
People Experiencing Homelessness 
State law requires that the City address the emergency housing needs of persons experiencing homelessness within the framework of this element. In attempting to document or identify the needs of persons experiencing homelessness, a “point in time” count was used. The 2020 homelessness point-in-time count, implemented by Santa Barbara County on January 29, 2020, indicated that 2 persons were experiencing homelessness in the Buellton/Solvang/Santa Ynez Valley area, compared to 5 persons in 2019. Although these numbers show a count at one point in time and only count what can be observed in shelters and streets, the county as a whole has seen an increase in the population who are experiencing homelessness since 2011. The count was at 1,698 (830 sheltered, 868 unsheltered) in 2011 and 1,897 (674 sheltered, 1,223 unsheltered) in 2020. These numbers indicate that unsheltered persons are becoming more prominent in the county, and 
the top three areas that have the highest counts of persons experiencing homelessness are the cities of Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, and Lompoc.  
Buellton does not have homeless shelters, but Santa Barbara Rescue Mission in the City of Santa Barbara and the organization Santa Ynez Valley People Helping People in Solvang adequately serve the needs of the transient homeless that may seek shelter in Buellton. In addition, the City partners with the aforementioned organizations as well as with Santa Barbara County Mental Health Mobile Crisis Service, the Food Bank of Santa Barbara County, Santa Ynez Valley Fruit and Vegetable Rescue, and the Buellton Senior Center, who all provide support for those at-risk and who are homeless. The City also contracts with the county Sheriff’s Department, who refer those at-risk and who are homeless to services and organizations such as People Helping People. Moreover, the City provides organization support and financial resources to the aforementioned organizations on a yearly basis. Buellton has also participated in the publication and adoption of the County’s Phase I and Phase II Community Action Plan to Address Homelessness, which calls for specific actions to be taken through region-wide collaboration to address homelessness. 
Farmworkers 
According to 2015-2019 ACS data estimates in industry, out of 2,685 civilians who work and are over the age of 16 years old, 111 Buellton residents (4.1%) are considered farmworkers, employed in the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting industry. 
The California Government Code requires that the City of Buellton consider local farmworker housing needs in formulating the housing element of its general plan. According to the last USDA Agricultural Census in 2017, there are 22,986 workers in Santa Barbara County who work in farms. In addition, the Census identified that 9,895 farmworkers are seasonal, working 150 days or less at a farm, and 13,090 workers work more than 150 days at a farm. Given that a small proportion work in Buellton, the few employed residents in this industry sector, as well as a portion of the potential housing needs for farmworkers in nearby communities, can be accommodated under housing for the general population. Actions and resources that would address the needs of low-income farm-workers, along with other low-income households, are addressed in Section B, Housing Plan. 
5. Housing Preservation Needs 
California Government Code §65583(a)(9)(A-D) requires “[a]n analysis of existing assisted housing developments that are eligible to change from low-income housing uses during the next 10 years due to termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage payment, or expiration of restrictions on use.” The study includes units at-risk during the ten-year period from February 15, 2023 to February 23, 2033. 
a. Inventory of Units At-Risk 
Based on an independent field survey conducted by the Planning staff in 2014, the City found that approximately 1% of the City’s overall housing stock is substandard and in need of major repair. While some of these are market rate units, there are three primary categories of low-income housing in the City of Buellton, including subsidized housing, Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) housing, and mobilehome parks. Each of these categories provides much needed housing to low-income persons, the elderly, and the disabled in the city and are described in more detail below. 
An inventory of subsidized affordable housing projects within Buellton is listed in Table H-21. This inventory includes all multiple-family units which are assisted under a variety of public and private programs. As shown on Table H-21, all of the city’s subsidized units have funding 
expiration dates well in the future and none would expire during the 10-year period identified above. Thus, no units in the city are at risk of changing from low-income units to market rate units during the 6th Cycle planning period.

As of 2022, four motels along the Avenue of Flags offer some or all of their rooms for long-term rental and are thus considered Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units. The motels’ use as SROs is legal non-conforming, which means SRO uses have never been permitted, but have been allowed to continue, as the motels had been used as such prior to the City’s incorporation. As motel rooms that are used as monthly rentals, they do not offer a permanent housing solution and lack some of the basic requirements of permanent housing, such as kitchen facilities. They have also contributed to disinvestment in the Avenue of Flags area as property owners lack the incentive to improve their properties.  
To provide adequate replacement housing for SRO residents and offer motel owners an incentive to revitalize their properties and the Avenue of Flags area, the City is embarking upon a program to encourage most of the properties to restore the SRO rooms to short-term “motel” room status. Pursuant to state law, a replacement program will be established to allow SRO residents to relocate to permanent housing at affordable rents. The City is in negotiations with the owners of two 
proposed affordable housing projects, Creekside Village and Polo Village, to provide the affordable housing units as part of those projects using in-lieu affordable housing funds to help construct the units. Residents will be given ample notice and opportunity to relocate to the new units when available.  
A summary of the status of each of the motel/SRO buildings as of 2022 is as follows:  
• 480 Avenue of Flags includes a total of 19 SRO units that will be demolished with the construction of Creekside Village. However, 10 of the new units in Creekside Village will be restricted to very-low and low income affordability and the current SRO residents will have first rights to occupy the affordable units. SRO residents will also be given the opportunity to find affordable housing that will be provided in the Polo Village project. 

• Farmhouse Motel (590 Avenue of Flags) includes approximately 20 occupied SRO units and was renovated within the last 2 years. The City will be working with the property owner to restore the units to motel room status, and residents of the SRO units will be given the opportunity to occupy low-income replacement housing units that will be provided in the Polo Village project. 

• San Marcos Motel (536 Avenue of Flags) is an active motel with 2 SRO units. The City will be working with the property owner to restore the units to motel room status, and residents of the SRO units will be given the opportunity to occupy low-income replacement housing units that will be provided in the Polo Village project. 

• Red Rose Court (435 Avenue of Flags) includes approximately 21 occupied SRO units that are referred to as “studio apartment” units. It is anticipated that this project will remain as is and continue to provide SRO units. 


Overall, it is anticipated that the occupants of 41 existing SRO units will be given the opportunity to relocate to new affordable housing units that will be provided in the Creekside Village and Polo Village projects. This will provide decent housing to the residents, restore short-term rentals in the City, and contribute to the revitalization of the Avenue of Flags area.  
There are two mobilehome parks in the City of Buellton, both senior age-restricted: Ranch Club Mobile Estates and the Rivergrove Mobile Home Park. Combined, the two parks comprise approximately 419 units and represent a significant source of lower income and senior housing in the city. It is estimated that 30 to 50 mobilehomes in the city are in need of major repair. As a significant source of low-income housing, the loss of any mobilehome units in the city due to disrepair would be significant. However, there is a program in place to fund mobilehome repairs and improvements, as discussed previously and outlined in more detail below. 
b. Preserving or Replacing Units At-Risk 
As outlined above, no subsidized housing units in the city are considered at risk for conversion to market rate housing or loss due to disrepair in the next 10 years. However, many of the city’s SRO units are at risk for conversion to short-term rentals or redevelopment into other uses. To protect this valuable form of low-income housing, the City will explore using inclusionary in-lieu funds to assist low-income persons relocating to other affordable units and/or a right to return ordinance that would allow existing residents to return to the buildings at affordable rates following conversion. 
Regarding mobilehome repairs, since 2015 the City has provided ongoing annual financial assistance to the Santa Ynez Valley Senior Citizens’ Foundation, administered by the Buellton Senior Center, to underwrite the expense of making emergency repairs to mobilehomes in the city. From 2015 to 2021, five mobilehomes completed repairs through the Emergency Mobile Home Repair Program. Repairs included the fixing of a roof leak, bathroom plumbing, windows, installation of wheelchair ramps, and the altering of a bathroom for assisted showers.  
By improving existing units, the City and the Foundation are helping preserve this important source of housing in the city. 
c. Available Resources 
As outlined above, resources include City actions to: consider allowing the legalization and improvement of SROs in the city; identify potential funding for the relocation of low-income SRO residents; work with the owners of Creekside Village and Polo Village to provide affordable units; and consider establishing a right to return program. For mobilehome preservation and improvement, the City and the Santa Ynez Valley Senior Citizens’ Foundation work together on an annual basis to make repairs to mobilehomes.  
6. Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing 
The City complies with California Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) requirements by taking meaningful actions to address impediments in Buellton. These impediments and the complete AFFH Analysis are located in Appendix B, and the programs and meaningful actions to address fair housing are located in Section B, Housing Plan. These analyses provide an assessment of the five main fair housing issue areas: 1) fair housing enforcement and capacity; 2) segregation and integration; 3) racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty (R/ECAPs) and racially concentrated areas of affluence (RCAAs); 4) access to opportunity; and 5) disproportionate housing needs and displacement risk. 
The summary of fair housing issues identified in the appendix is reflected from the limited available data for the City since its size is approximately 1.6 square miles and the entire city boundary line fits within one much larger and somewhat disparate Census Tract and overlaps three Census Block Groups. These Census data also expand into the unincorporated regions surrounding the city. Data from the City, such as the National Demographic Corporation (NDC) By-District Elections demographic data and surveys, and local knowledge were also used to consider the existing fair housing issues of the City. 
In summary, as shown in the AFFH analysis, Buellton is predominantly Latinx-White and its geography shows a pattern of general integration, showing that no high concentrations of poverty and affluence currently exist that can be a fair housing concern when associated with a single race or ethnic groups. In addition, Buellton offers high opportunity areas but faces some challenges in promoting and providing a range of housing types and prices suitable for lower-income households. Providing a range of affordable housing can help foster more inclusive communities and promote access to opportunities for persons of color, persons with disabilities, and other protected classes.  
From the AFFH analysis, this section summarizes four key fair housing issues, which are also included in Section B, Program 8 – Fair Housing, with details on how each issue below will be addressed by the City. Moreover, all the programs outlined in the entirety of the Housing Plan, 
whether indirectly or directly, are contributing towards furthering fair housing in the City of Buellton.  
Summary of Fair Housing Issues 
According to HCD, a fair housing issue is a condition in a geographic area of analysis that restricts fair housing choice or access to opportunity. The following summarizes the key fair housing issues in the City of Buellton:  
Issue #1: Insufficient Outreach and Education on Fair Housing Rights 
A key approach to reduce fair housing issues is outreach and education. In the “Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice,” 386 residents in Santa Barbara County were surveyed on their knowledge of “fair housing rights.” The survey found that 23% of respondents were not familiar with the laws and 45% indicated they were not familiar with fair housing rights. In addition, the survey also found that 50% of the respondents were not aware of any fair housing or anti-discrimination education opportunities in their community and the majority of the survey respondents (85%), have never participated in any kind of educational opportunity. Although Buellton residents did not participate in this survey, the City is aware that some residents have expressed their housing concerns to City staff. Those concerned residents are then referred to other agencies who have the resources to assist them. How often or any data that measures this concurrency is currently not available.  
Though the City does not have its own fair housing enforcement agency it does have a Code Enforcement service which addresses planning code violations, building code violations, and conditions of units. However, outreach and education on fair housing rights is one of the approaches to promote fair housing choice and foster inclusive socio-economic communities. The City, along with partnered agencies offering resources and education on fair housing rights, can increase outreach and education on fair housing rights. 
Issue #2: Housing Disparities for Low-Income Residents, Elderly, and Persons with Disabilities 
The AFFH analysis and the housing inventory in Section E showed housing disparities for low-income residents, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. These protected groups are often found to be housing cost-burdened and living in substandard housing and/or overcrowded conditions. For instance, according to HUD’s 2014-2018 CHAS data, 35.5% (664) of the 1,870 total households (both homeowners and renters) are housing cost-burdened. The latest data, 2015-2019, from HUD CHAS shows that 31.1% (603) of the 1,940 estimated households (in all income categories) are housing cost-burdened. These data differences shows a decrease of households experiencing housing cost-burden by about 60 households. The data also showed that approximately half of the renter households are cost-burdened. It is important to note that, as previously stated, low-income households are more impacted by housing cost-burden than moderate and upper income households, who can better afford the increased housing cost-burden without experiencing hardships. 
Buellton has an older population where, according to the 2015-2019 ACS, 47.5% of its 5,082 population is at least 45 years or older and about 16% of the population is 65 years or over. In addition, 891 households (or 40.2% of all households) are considered an “elderly family” because they consist of at least two persons age 62 years or over. In addition, 35.1% of the seniors have a disability and 3.9% of seniors are considered low-income.  
The figures on cost-burdened low-income residents and elderly can be compared with the number of the current affordable housing units to-date, which is approximately 43 units (see Table H-21 above). The City has opportunities to develop more affordable units by encouraging the development of a range of housing options, such as ADUs and affordable housing units on AHOZ sites. The development of a diverse range of housing options will increase housing opportunities for special needs groups in the City of Buellton, including senior households.  
Issue #3: Displacement Risk for Low-Income Residents 
Low-income cost-burdened residents in the city are at a greater risk of losing shelter and becoming homeless. In addition, low-income residents living in financially stressful situations can lead to socioeconomic consequences, impacting their social, physical, and mental health, especially for residents who live in overcrowded and substandard conditions. These consequences become barriers to opportunities and upward social mobility. 
For the residents currently living in SROs along the Avenue of Flags, 85% of the 68 residents surveyed in 2020 had a household income of $25,000 or less. It is worth noting that this represents an improvement over the prior survey in 2017, which found that 91% of the 110 residents surveyed lived below an annual household income of $25,000. In addition, the 2017 survey, 8 families were found to live in single rooms without a kitchen, a condition that HUD considers substandard. 
Opportunities to help address low-income residents and reduce the risk of displacement and homelessness are found in resources offered by the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara. The Housing Authority provides Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8) to assist low-income households in Buellton and in the county. In addition, mobilehome parks in the city are an affordable option.  
Issue #4: Substandard Housing Conditions 
Substandard housing conditions do exist in the City of Buellton, but these units represent a significantly small portion of existing housing units. The 2015-2019 ACS data estimates that approximately 2.2% units of the 1,941 occupied housing units lack complete kitchen facilities, making the units substandard. However, this number is an estimate with a large margin of error and conflicts with local information collected by the City. The City has supplemented with additional data, which can be found above under “Substandard Housing” in Section C, as well as Appendix B, and found that units with substandard housing issues represent approximately 1% of all the existing units and most are located in SROs and mobilehomes. 
To address these housing conditions, the City has a Code Enforcement Service where residents can fill out a service request form and a Code Enforcement Officer responds accordingly depending on what code has been violated. Substandard housing conditions are addressed by performing building inspections, which are done by building inspectors from the County of Santa Barbara, which the City is in contract with. In addition to the code enforcement service, the City provides ongoing annual financial assistance for emergency repairs in mobilehomes, a program called Emergency Mobile Home Repair Program. 
Given the current high housing costs and high inflation rates, low-income persons living in housing units without a kitchen or in other substandard conditions could face lasting socioeconomic, physical, and mental consequences. The City has the opportunity to eliminate 
substandard housing by ensuring that the residents of the city are informed about their rights to a healthy home and how substandard conditions can be addressed; and assessing if additional funding is necessary to address housing conditions that are in violation of federal, state, and local codes.  
D. Constraints Analysis 
1. Governmental Constraints 
Local policies and regulations can affect the quantity and type of residential development. Because governmental actions can constrain the development and the affordability of housing, state law requires the housing element to “address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing” (Government Code §65583(C)(3)). 
The City’s primary policies and regulations that affect residential development and housing affordability include: the Zoning Ordinance, the General Plan, development processing procedures and fees, on-site and off-site improvement requirements, and the California Building and Housing Codes. In addition to a review of these policies and regulations, an analysis of the governmental constraints on housing production for persons with disabilities is included in this section. 
Pursuant to Government Code §65585, the City provides all application forms, fee schedules, and development regulations via the Municipal Code on the City’s website.  
a. Land Use Policy 
General Plan Land Use Designations 
The City of Buellton adopted the General Plan 2025 in 2007 and the Housing Element was last revised in 2015. The Land Use Element of the General Plan directs the location and form of future development in the city. The General Plan includes four land use designations that allow a range of residential development types (see Table H-22), at a variety of densities. 
Table H-22 City General Plan Residential Land Use Designations 
General Plan Designation 
 Description 
 
Very Low Density Residential (VLDR) 
 The Very Low Density Residential designation is applied to lands intended for single family detached and attached homes, secondary residential units, public and quasi-public uses, and similar compatible uses. Residential densities shall be in the range of 1 to 2 units per acre, except in areas where topography or other conditions warrant even lower densities. The possible range of low density residential projects includes custom dwellings, tract homes, and planned development projects that allow for design flexibility and innovation. 
 
Low Density Residential (LR) 
 The Low Density Residential designation is applied to lands intended for single family detached and attached homes, secondary residential units, public and quasi-public uses, and similar compatible uses. Residential densities shall be in the range of 3 to 6 units per acre, except in areas where topography or other conditions warrant even lower densities. The possible range of low density residential products includes custom dwellings, tract homes and planned development projects that allow for design flexibility and innovation.  
 
Medium Density Residential (MDR) 
 The Medium Density Residential designation is intended to accommodate both attached and detached single family residential development, including mobilehomes, duplexes, condominiums, and planned development projects. Residential densities shall be in the range of 4 to 8 units per acre.  
 
Multi-Family Residential (MFR) 
 This designation provides for single and multi-family residential units, public and quasi-public uses, and similar compatible uses. Residential densities shall be in the range of 9 to 16 units per gross acre.

Zoning Ordinance 
The Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 19 of the Buellton Municipal Code, was partially amended in 2015 to be consistent with the 5th Cycle Housing Element Update. The Zoning Code and the Zoning Map are available on the City’s website, consistent with Government Code §65940.1(a)(1)(B). There are four zones that allow residential development. Table H-23 lists the zones that allow residential uses. 
Table H-23 Zones Allowing Residential Uses 
Zone 
 Description 
 
Single-family Residential (RS) 
 The RS zoning district is intended to reserve appropriately located areas for family living in detached dwelling units at a reasonable range of population densities, consistent with sound standards of public health, safety, and welfare. The RS zoning district is consistent with the low density residential designation of the general plan. The RM zoning district provides areas for duplexes triplexes, fourplexes, apartments, condominiums, other multiple-family dwellings, and detached single-family dwellings at higher densities than found in the RS zone, and is intended to allow flexibility and encourage innovation and diversity in the design of residential developments. A wide range of densities and housing types are allowed, while requiring developments to incorporate substantial amounts of open space. The RM zoning district is consistent with the medium density residential and multi-family residential designations of the general plan. Mixed-use projects with a commercial component are permitted subject to the regulations contained in Chapter 19.18. 
 
Planned Residential District (PRD) 
 The PRD zoning district is applied to areas designated by the general plan for residential use that have sensitive environmental, visual, or other characteristics which can be benefited by flexible and innovative design, so that a development can provide for desirable aesthetic and efficient use of space, and preserve significant natural, scenic, and cultural site resources. This district is also intended to: encourage clustering of structures to preserve a maximum amount of open space; allow for a diversity of housing types; and provide recreational opportunities for both site residents and the public. The PRD zoning district is consistent with the low density residential, medium density residential, and multi-family residential designations of the general plan. 
 
Mobilehome Park (MHP) 
 The MHP district provides areas for mobilehomes on nonpermanent foundations in planned developments such as mobilehome rental parks and mobilehome condominiums. The intent is to provide affordable housing opportunities, and to ensure a safe and attractive residential environment by promoting high standards of site planning, architecture, and landscaping design. The MHP zoning district is consistent with the medium density residential designation of the general plan. 
 

 
• Overlay Zone: The City’s sole overlay zone, the Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ), applies to key commercially and industrially zoned sites and allows stand-alone residential projects at a density of 25 units/acre provided that a minimum of 20% of the units are affordable. The AHOZ designation provides property owners with a voluntary option to develop housing at densities greater than the underlying zoning designation would otherwise allow. • Specific Plans: As of 2022, there are two adopted specific plans in effect in the City: the Village Specific Plan and the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan. The Village Specific Plan allows for a wide range of residential units including single-family, multi-family, and senior housing. The Avenue of Flags Specific Plan focuses on mixed-use development, allowing for residential dwelling units above ground-floor commercial spaces as well as live-work units. The Specific Plan does not allow for 100 percent residential development. Additionally, the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan allows for emergency shelters, farm employee housing, and special needs housing. The Avenue of Flags Specific Plan is intended to revitalize the city’s primary commercial and tourist area. Mixed use development in the city’s core is critical to the City’s fiscal sustainability, its ability to provide a jobs/housing balance, and reduce vehicle miles traveled. While the Specific Plan only allows for dense, mixed-use development, there are currently four legal non-conforming Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) buildings within the Specific Plan area. The focus on mixed-use in the city’s core allows for more flexibility in where new housing units can be constructed, which should result in more choices in housing types and locations, particularly for residents looking for more urban options.  

• Mixed-Use Ordinance: Chapter 19.18 (Mixed Use Regulations) includes general requirements, development standards, and incentives for mixed use development. The chapter provides an opportunity for mixed-use development with a combination of residential, commercial, office, industrial, or live/work uses. The standards are intended for projects with a combination of permitted uses applicable to the underlying zoning designation. While the chapter provides specific development standards for mixed-use development, it utilizes the existing residential, commercial, and industrial zones to allow for combinations of uses permitted in each of those zones.

Table H-27 and Table H-28 provide the development standards for The Village Specific Plan and the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan, respectively. The Village Specific Plan is treated as Planned Residential District (PRD), so certain standards such as site coverage, open space, and building height must conform to the standards of the Zoning Ordinance while setbacks are dictated by the proposed Development Plan. In addition, the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan is a form-based code that assigns development standards to specific building types that are allowed in certain designated districts within the Plan. Each district is intended for mixed-use development with residential uses required to be above ground-floor non-residential uses. Allowable density and building height maximums may be increased through the use of the City’s Development Opportunity Reserve (DOR) incentive program. The DOR program is voluntary and is applied on a project-specific basis only within the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area to incentivize new development in financially significant ways (e.g., density bonus, parking reduction) in exchange for support of community objectives (e.g., median/parking improvements, public restrooms). The DOR program does contain specific requirements or findings, the terms are negotiated and memorialized by development agreements and/or other suitable mechanisms. Any project that utilizes the DOR incentive program requires a discretionary approval from the City Council. 
Utilization of the DOR incentive program is dependent on negotiations between the applicant and Planning Department staff in terms of the project needs, such as a density increase, height increase, or parking reduction, and what the applicant can provide in exchange for community objectives such as the funding/construction of public restrooms, funding of park improvements, installation of public art, or funding of a public parking lot. Incentives are applied on a project-by-project basis and are not subject to specific findings, the applicant and City staff negotiate the terms of the incentives which are then memorialized in a development agreement. The DOR incentive program provides benefits for both the applicant and the City in terms of getting development benefits for both entities and allowing for taller, denser mixed-use development in the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area.

The multi-family development standards and the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan allow for three-story buildings and in some cases, taller than three stores in the Specific Plan area. The baseline allowable density for mixed-use projects in the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area are determined by the Land Use Element of the City’s General Plan and then allowing for that baseline density to at least double when utilizing DOR incentives. A conventional mixed-use development in the Specific Plan area, without incentives, would consist of one floor of commercial space with two floors of multi-family residential units above and the density is determined by the allowable size of the building footprint in relation to the lot size, height restriction, setbacks, and other requirements such as on-site parking. When utilizing the DOR incentives, a development could get up to two more floors of residential units, for a total of five stories (one commercial and four residential). The precise density increase for each project is dependent on negotiations between the developer and City staff and the community benefit exchange for the density increase. Density may be potentially increased up to 25-40 dwelling units per acre in conjunction with a community benefit such as the funding and/or construction of an off-site public parking lot. While the applicant will request the density increase relative to their site constraints, it is ultimately left to the City Council to decide if the density increase is met with a commensurate community benefit. Given the form-based zoning 
standards and the building types, the standards for commercial floors and residential floors work in conjunction with one another since the building types are solely dictating the envelope of the building with the interior build-out of each development being informed by the form of each building type. These form-based standards provide predictability for developers and the City due to the objective development standards and therefore certainty in how the buildings will look once developed, eliminating subjectivity from the process. 
Table H-29 provides development standards for mixed-use developments in specific zones. The development standards that apply to each mixed-use project are from the primary use (base zone) zoning. The primary use must be consistent with the underlying zoning designation and must be equivalent to 50% or greater of the total floor space. Tentative and final parcel maps shall be required for all mixed-use projects that include the creation of lots, condominiums, stock cooperatives, community apartment, and planned unit development, both new and conversion. Mixed-use projects are also subject to the design requirements of the Community Design Guidelines. 
With Multifamily Residential being the primary use, the mixed-use development standards allow for increased site coverage, a smaller minimum lot area, and small front and rear yard setbacks. While the mixed-use development standards do not allow for an increased maximum height and residential density standard, the relaxed site coverage, minimum lot area, and setback standards could make a mixed-use project more feasible and therefore incentivize development. The allowance of residential multi-family dwellings in CN, CR, CS, and M zoning districts opens up more opportunities for housing production in other areas of the city. The general lack of minimum lot area, relaxed setbacks, and increased net site areas creates more opportunities for site development and do not present a constraint to housing development.  
The mixed-use development standards allow for three stories or more, depending on the base zoning district, as shown in the table above. In addition to the development standards, the Mixed-Use Ordinance includes specific standards for landscaping and residential open space. A mixed-use project in the RM zone requires a minimum of 30% of the net site area to be landscaped. All other base zoning districts require a minimum of 15% of the net site area to be landscaped. Up to 25% of the required landscaped area may be decorative hardscape, including, but not limited to, decorative paving, fountains, statues or other artwork, and seating areas. In addition, an open space area of 250 square feet is required per residential unit, exclusive of the required landscaping. The open space areas shall contain useable amenities such as outdoor seating areas, barbeques, child play areas, water features, pools/spas, basketball or volleyball courts, and similar amenities. Private patio or balcony areas can be included in the required area. Lastly, if the façade of an existing mixed-use building is renovated in accordance with the community design guidelines when not required by the municipal code, then the open space requirements can be waived. Mixed-use developments require a lower amount of required landscaping and open space compared to the base zoning districts and therefore are not a constraint to the development of housing.

The Avenue of Flags Specific Plan and the Mixed-Use development standards adhere to the same parking rates that are in the Zoning Code, but two means of parking reduction are included to incentivize the Plan’s intent for mixed-use development: 
1. Parking Reduction: A 25% reduction in the number of parking spaces from the base number for the project may be granted through the development plan permit process if a City of Buellton owned parking lot is located within a 500-foot radius of the project site. No more than 50% of the public parking lot spaces shall be encumbered for this purpose on a cumulative project basis. 
• If an applicant uses a City parking lot to satisfy a portion of their parking requirement, then a parking fee of $18,000 per space shall be paid prior to issuance of building permits for the project. The fee is based on the engineers’ cost to pave one parking space, and the funds will be used to offset the maintenance costs of the City parking lot. 

• In no case shall the amount of parking be reduced to less than one space for every residential unit. 



2. Shared Parking: Parking requirements may be partially satisfied through a shared parking agreement with properties within 500 feet of the project site. This may only be allowed through the development plan if the shared parking lot has parking spaces in excess of that required for the uses on that property, or that the shared parking is intended for use during the non-peak hours of the uses on the shared parking property. 
The parking requirements for each housing type are consistent across all zoning districts and are consistent with other jurisdictions in the region and do not present a constraint to development. 
c. Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types 
The City has adopted provisions in its Zoning Ordinance that facilitate a range of residential development types. Table H-31 provides a list of housing types and the zone in which they are 
subject to a Zoning Clearance (A), a Minor Conditional Use Permit (MUP), a Conditional Use Permit (CUP), a Development Plan (DP), or are not permitted (N).

d. Supplemental Use Standards 
Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) 
Section 19.06.180 of the Zoning Ordinance provides the additional development standards that are required for any proposed ADU or Junior ADU (JADU). The standards include objective design standards such as requiring the exterior colors, materials, and roof slope of the ADU to match the primary dwelling. Additionally, the section specifies three “Restricted Areas” where ADUs and JADUs are not allowed “due to public safety and traffic flow concerns” unless the number of code-required off-street parking spaces are provided on-site for all existing or proposed primary residences and one off-street parking space is provided per unit for all proposed ADUs and JADUs.  
In February 2022, HCD’s Division of Housing Policy Development issued a review of the City’s ADU ordinance under state ADU law (Government Code §65852.2). HCD raised potential issues with the City’s standards as follows: 
• Restricted Areas: The Ordinance’s prohibition on ADUs and JADUs in specific areas unless off-street parking can be provided violates Government Code §65852.2(d)(1), which states that parking standards shall not be imposed when the accessory dwelling unit is located within one-half mile walking distance of public transit. The Ordinance’s restricted areas are within a one-half-mile walk to a bus stop. 

• Efficiency Kitchen Standards: The Ordinance defines an efficiency kitchen to include a food preparation counter with an area of at least 15 square feet, and food storage cabinets with a minimum of 30 square feet of shelf space. However, Government Code §§65852.22(a)(6)(A) and (B) only require that an efficiency kitchen include a food preparation counter and storage cabinets that are “of reasonable size” in relation to the size of the JADU.  

• Separate Conveyance Prohibition: The Ordinance prohibits the separate conveyance of an ADU or JADU. However, in limited circumstances, Government Code §65852.26 allows for the separate conveyance of an ADU if it meets all the requirements of subdivision (a) of the statute.  

• Subjective Design Standards: The Ordinance includes subjective terms such as “impede safe ingress,” “compatible,” “excessive noise,” and “adversely affect” in its development/design standards. Government Code §65852.2(a)(4) requires that jurisdictions “provide an approval process that includes only ministerial provisions for the approval of accessory dwelling units and shall not include any discretionary processes, provisions, or requirements for those units…” In addition, subdivision (a)(6) states that “no additional standards, other than those provided in this subdivision, shall be used or imposed.” The Ordinance’s use of subjective terms violates the statute.  

• Fences: The Ordinance’s requirement for ADUs to have fencing along the side and rear property lines is unclear in its intent regarding the requirements for the primary structure.  

• Open Space Requirement: The Ordinance requires an open space area “… shall be commonly accessible to both the main unit and the ADU unless otherwise approved by the director.” But, there is no further elaboration on how the director would approve such a design element exception which could lead to a subjective review and administrative burden. Government Code §65852.2(a)(4) states that “[a]n existing ordinance governing the creation of an accessory dwelling unit by a local agency or an accessory dwelling ordinance adopted by a local agency shall provide an approval process that includes only ministerial provisions for the approval of accessory dwelling units and shall not include any discretionary processes, provisions, or requirements for those units.” 

• Accessory Structure: The Ordinance states that “except for exempt ADUs described in Section D.3 of this Chapter, an ADU shall not be permitted on a lot zoned for single-family use, in addition to a guest house or similar structure.” This standard is in conflict with Government Code §65852.2(a)(6), which states that “no additional standards, other than those provided in this subdivision, shall be used or imposed…”. According to HDC, the prior existence of another accessory structure on a lot cannot preclude the development of an ADU built under Government Code §65852.2(a). • Application Procedure: The Ordinance currently has an approval process in place for ADUs, including a “Project Application Form” and an “ADU/JADU Application Checklist,” and the requirement that “associated approvals” be secured “when other permits are required that are subject to discretionary review by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission.” However, state law requires only ministerial provisions be applied to ADU approvals.  

• ADU Exemption: The Ordinance stipulates that “certain categories of ADUs shall be permitted without applying local development standards…if proposed on a lot developed with one single-family home.” However, Government Code §65852.2(a)(1) states that jurisdictions “provide for the creation of accessory dwelling units in areas zoned to allow single-family or multi-family dwelling residential use,” not limited to a lot developed with one single-family home.  


The City is working on revising its ADU ordinance in response to HDCs letter. See Program 2. 
Condominiums, Stock Cooperatives, Community Apartments 
Section 19.06.060 of the Zoning Ordinance contains the following supplemental requirements for condominiums, stock cooperatives, and community apartments which may be applied by the Planning Commission or City Council as conditions of approval: 
• Each dwelling unit shall be provided with at least one hundred eighty (180) cubic feet of weatherproofed, enclosed, lockable, and easily accessible storage space on-site in addition to the usable storage space of closets, cabinets, and pantry within the dwelling units; 

• Individual metering for utilities shall be provided for each unit, unless the metering would conflict with an innovative energy-efficient or resource conserving utility system, designed for the project; 

• Each unit shall include private outdoor patio area in the form of ground level patios or upper story balconies. Private patios shall not be less than twenty (20) percent of the gross floor area of the residence served. Where a required patio area is less than two hundred (200) square feet, the requirements shall be satisfied with one patio or balcony per unit; 

• Common open space and recreation areas shall be designated to provide access for the handicapped. 


All standards in this section are objective and do not pose a constraint to the development of condominiums, stock cooperatives, or community apartments. 
Emergency Shelters 
Section 19.06.260 of the Zoning Ordinance provides the following standards for emergency shelters: 
• The property is located more than five hundred (500) feet from any other emergency shelter and approval will not result in an over-concentration of emergency shelters in the surrounding area; and 

• That not more than thirty (30) persons, exclusive of staff, will be permitted on the site, if the proposed shelter is located on a lot or parcel of land of less than one acre; and 

• On-site parking spaces shall be provided as required in Section 19.04.142; and 

• That the land uses and developments in the immediate vicinity of the site will not constitute an immediate or potential hazard to occupants of the shelter; and  • The facility must conform to all development standards of the zoning district in which it is located, except as modified by this section; and 

• Emergency shelters are to be available to residents for no more than sixty (60) days. Extensions up to a total stay of one hundred eighty (180) days may be provided, if no alternative housing is available; and 

• The shelter shall be operated by a responsible agency or organization, with experience in managing or providing social services. On-site management and appropriate security shall be provided at the shelter. 


The provisions of Section 19.060.260 were last updated in 2010. Objective development standards for emergency shelters, per Government Code §65583(a)(4), were last updated in 2022. The City’s development standards for emergency shelters are not in compliance with current state law and could potentially constrain their development as a result. The objective standards for Emergency Shelters will be brought into compliance with current state law as a program of this Housing Element, specifically to update the separation standard from 500 feet to 300 feet and to update the parking requirement so that parking is based on demonstrated need and cannot be more than a residential or commercial use in the same zone. See Program 3.a. 
Government Code §65583(a)(4) requires jurisdictions to identify a zone or zones that allow residential uses, including mixed uses, where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use or other discretionary permit. Emergency shelters are permitted by-right in the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area, which specifically allows for mixed use development, through a zoning clearance approval, and therefore the City is in compliance with Government Code §65583(a)(4). The zoning clearance is a ministerial approval process based on objective standards. The Avenue of Flags Specific Plan does not contain development standards that would constrain the development of Emergency Shelters. The Specific Plan contains objective, form-based standards based on established building types. Among the allowable building types, they must be a minimum of 16 feet in height and could be up to 50 feet in height when applying Development Opportunity Reserve incentives.  
The General Commercial (CR) zone also allows for Emergency Shelters through a zoning clearance approval despite not allowing residential uses, including mixed uses. The CR development standards are minimal and do not present a constraint to development. The CR does not have minimum lot area, front setback, side setback, site coverage, or floor area standards. The CR zone only requires a rear setback maximum of 10 feet, when not adjacent to residential zoning districts, 5-foot minimum interior setback for residential structures, and a height limit of 35 feet which allows buildings to be three stories, if proposed. 
The Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area and the CR zone have adequate capacity to accommodate an emergency shelter. Specifically, the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area and the CR zone contains two vacant parcels, APNs 137-190-017 and 137-170-043, which could accommodate emergency shelters. Both parcels are centrally located within the city’s downtown area and are within immediate walking distance of bus stops and less than a mile from services such as City Hall, a grocery store, a pharmacy, and two banks. These sites do not possess hazardous conditions or any other conditions inappropriate for human habitat, they are vacant lots in downtown with prime access to transportation, goods, and services. The existing zoning clearance approval process does not present a constraint to the development of Emergency Shelters in the CR zone and Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area.  
In addition, emergency shelters are permitted in the Multi-Family Residential (RM), Service Commercial (CS), and Industrial/Manufacturing (M) zones through the approval of a conditional use permit. There are properties suitable for the establishment of an emergency shelter in the M zone in the northern ends and southern ends of the City’s jurisdictional boundaries. The M zone land area contains large, underutilized parcels that are appropriate in size and are capable of being converted for use as an emergency shelter. The identification of additional zones where emergency shelters are permitted with a conditional use permit is also in compliance with Government Code §65583(a)(4). 
Farmworker Housing 
The Zoning Ordinance contains two separate residential use types for farmworker housing: “Agricultural Employee Housing” and “Farm Employee Housing.” Both residential use types are from Santa Barbara County’s Zoning Ordinance, which the City utilized prior to incorporation in 1992. The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not contain consistent definitions for either use and permits each use differently throughout the zone districts. Agricultural Employee Housing does not have a specific definition but is treated the same as a single-family structure and is permitted by-right in the same zone districts, although the use does contain a different parking standard than single-family dwellings. Section 19.02.140 of the City’s Zoning Ordinance requires off-street parking to be provided at a ratio of one space per habitable room, two of which must be covered, whereas single-family dwellings are only required to have two covered parking spaces per dwelling unit. Alternatively, Farm Employee Housing is defined as housing occupied by employees of a farm with a maximum of thirty-six (36) beds in a group quarters or twelve (12) units or spaces and the use requires a Conditional Use Permit in the majority of zone districts where the use is allowed. The Zoning Ordinance does not contain any specific use standards for Farm Employee Housing or any further use description to justify the Conditional Use Permit requirement. The utilization of two different farmworker housing descriptions for essentially the same use without clear definitions for either could cause confusion for applicants and City officials, potentially constraining the development of this residential use. The City will consolidate its farmworker housing use types and ensure full compliance with Health and Safety Code §17021.5 and §17021.6. See Program 3b. 
Live-work/Work-live Units 
Section 19.18.026 dictates that live-work/work-live units are allowed in the CN, CR, CS, and M zoning districts, when part of a mixed-use development. Uses allowed in these units include photography studios, artist studios, craftspersons and workshops, professional-technical service trades and researchers, and are allowed in an approved mixed-use live-work/work-live project subject to issuance of a zoning clearance. Section 19.18.026 requires the following supplemental standards: 
• Live-work/work-live units are the only residential units permitted in the CS and M zoning districts. 

• Live-work/work-live units shall be limited to studios or one-bedroom units. No more than 50 percent of the unit shall be devoted to living space. 

• Live-work/work-live units shall be incorporated into the commercial or industrial building and shall not be standalone units or buildings. 

• Any building containing a live-work/work-live occupancy shall comply with the standards of the latest adopted edition of the California Building Code (CBC), including standards for habitability. • Any live-work/work-live unit shall comply with the performance standards set forth in Section 19.18.024, along with the following standards: 


The majority of the supplemental standards are already requirements per the California Building Code. The development standards for live-work/work-live units are typical to the residential type and do not present a constraint to the development of housing.  
Mobilehomes on Foundations 
Section 19.06.110 of the Zoning Ordinance provides the following standards for mobilehomes that are certified under the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and constructed on a permanent foundation system, pursuant to Health and Safety Code §18551: 
• The mobilehome shall have a roof overhang unless waived by the commission because the absence of a roof overhang would be appropriate and of good design in relation to other structures on the site and in the immediately affected surrounding area; 

• Roofing and siding shall be nonreflective; and 

• Siding shall extend to the ground level. 


Mobilehomes on foundations should only be subject to the same development standards as a conventional single-family residential dwelling. Section 19.02.120 (Residential zone general development standards) does not include standards for roof overhangs, nonreflective roofing and siding, and siding extending to the ground level. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to 
remove the specific requirements for mobilehomes on foundations since they are not also required for single-family residential structures and could present a constraint to their development. In addition, the Zoning Ordinance will be amended to specifically identify Manufactured Housing (which includes mobilehomes on foundations) as a defined residential use type that is considered a single-family residential unit. See Programs 3.h and 3.i. 
Mobilehome Parks 
Section 19.06.120 contains specific development standards for the development of mobilehome parks, particularly setbacks for individual mobilehome sites: 
• Front: 10 feet minimum from the front line of the mobilehome lot. 

• Side: 5 feet minimum from the side line of the mobilehome lot; 10 feet minimum from any access road, parking area, or walkway. 

• Rear: 10 feet minimum from the rear line of the mobilehome lot. 

• Interior: 10 feet between mobilehomes. 


In addition, mobilehome parks must adhere to the following miscellaneous requirements:  
• All mobilehomes shall be skirted. 

• Tool sheds and equipment storage structures shall be permitted on each site but shall not be located in any setback area. 

• All development shall be in compliance with the California Code of Regulations, Title 25, Housing and Community Development. 


All standards in this section are objective and do not pose a constraint to the development of mobilehome parks in Buellton.  
Multi-Family 
Section 19.04.120 of the Zoning Ordinance contains the following open space and landscaping standards specific to multi-family developments. 
• Not less than forty (40) percent of the net area of the property shall be devoted to common open space. 

• Any driveway or uncovered parking area shall be separated from property lines by a landscaped strip not less than five feet in width. 

• In the case of cluster development, the perimeter of the development shall be landscaped with a minimum strip of ten feet. 


Given the 30 percent maximum of net site area for dwellings and the 40 percent minimum of net area for open space, the following table displays how the maximum density of 16 dwelling units per acer could be achieved.

 One bedroom/Studio - 1 space 
Two bedroom – 2 spaces 
Three or more bedrooms – 2.5 spaces 
Visitor parking – 1 per 5 units 
 Remaining site area: 13,068 square feet 
Average of 2 spaces per unit plus 3 visitor spaces = 7,000 square feet.  
 
 
 Total Site Coverage + Parking spaces = 20,068 square feet 
Total Open Space = 17,068 square feet 
TOTAL: 37,136 square feet (Site coverage, parking, open space) 
Total remaining land area 6,424 square feet 
 

 
The maximum permitted density can be achieved with the development standards for the zone. There is no constraint on development. As the example above demonstrates, the development capacity with the current development standards is more than adequate to accommodate a range of unit sizes. 
To ensure the existing development standards, particularly site area, open space, and landscaping, are not a constraint to the development of multi-family housing, City staff will monitor new multi-family development applications to determine if these development standards are constraining the development of multi-family housing. If, based on the evidence, the development standards are determined to be a constraint, City staff will amend the Zoning Ordinance to remove the constraints. See Program 1.e. 
Planned Residential Developments (PRDs) 
Section 19.02.130 of the City’s Zoning Ordinances provides the zoning standards and required findings for any project that seeks to rezone to a PRD. The zoning standards specific to PRDs are minimal, in that there is no minimum lot size and no standard setback requirements. The maximum density allowed in a PRD zone is determined by the specifications of such site within the Land Use Element of the Buellton General Plan. Specific setbacks are proposed by the applicant within their Development Plan and are determined on the basis of preserving sensitive site characteristics, privacy, access to light and air, solar exposure, building configuration, and aesthetics. Any new streets proposed within the PRD are subject to the City’s Public Works specifications, and required parking is dependent on the residential use type per the parking requirements in Section 19.04.140. Lastly, similarly to multi-family developments, all PRDs are required to provide a minimum of 40 percent of gross acreage to permanent open space.  
If an applicant seeks to utilize the PRD zoning designation, they must first apply for a rezoning by approval of the City Council. In order to rezone to a PRD, the following findings must be made: 
• The site is of the type and character that is appropriate for a planned residential development in accordance with the purpose of the PRD zoning district described in Section 19.02.100(C) of this chapter. 

• The overall estimated population density which will result upon full development of the property under the planned residential development district in accordance with the development plan is appropriate for the site and will not have a detrimental effect upon surrounding areas nor exceed the capacity of city services and utility facilities. 

• The proposed development as shown on the development plan is in conformance with all applicable policies of the general plan, and the requirements of this title. 


Similar to a normal rezoning process, requiring approval of the City Council to rezone a property or multiple properties to PRD does not present a constraint to the development of housing. Once the rezoning is approved by the City Council, the applicant must present a Development Plan for the consideration of the Planning Commission. In order to approve the PRD Development Plan, the following findings must be made: 
• That the density and type of the proposed development is in conformance with the PRD district and applicable general plan policies. 

• The adequate provisions have been made within the proposed covenants, conditions, and restrictions to establish permanent care and maintenance of public and common open spaces and recreational areas and facilities.  

• That the buildings and structures are clustered to the maximum extent feasible to provide the maximum amount of contiguous open space.  

• That the proposed development is in conformance is in conformance with community design guidelines. 


Utilizing the PRD zoning designation for a development project is optional. An applicant can choose to rezone and utilize the lack of specific zoning standards depending on unique site characteristics, a desired density, or the type of residential development. The city currently has one PRD-zoned site, Rancho de Maria, which contains approximately 200 units of single-family housing and satisfies its Open Space requirement with the preservation of Zaca Creek and the development of a golf course. The open space is zoned PRD-OS to permanently preserve the area as open space. The amount of available land for large residential developments is limited in Buellton, making future PRDs unlikely. But, the zoning standards and approval process was effectuated through the construction of Rancho de Maria and therefore the PRD standards do not present a constraint to housing development. 
Short-Term Rentals 
Section 19.02.150 of the City’s Zoning Ordinance defines a short-term rental as a lodging unit with an occupancy period of thirty (30) consecutive days or less and expressly prohibits such use in all residential zoning districts. Memorialized in Ordinance No. 15-03, the City Council found that visitors and tourists who rent short-term lodging units in residential zoning districts can increase the demand for city services and law enforcement and create adverse impacts, including excessive noise, disorderly conduct, vandalism, overcrowding, traffic and parking congestion, and accumulations of refuse. Their determination that that short-term lodging in residential zoning districts presents a threat to public welfare and therefore prohibited the use in all residential zoning districts. The prohibition of short-term rentals in residential zoning districts mandates that all rental units in residential zoning districts to be for long-term rental periods of more than 30 
days and therefore does not constrain the development of housing. Lastly, the City does not have any other codified growth-control ordinances that would constrain residential development. 
Single Room Occupancy (SROs) 
A Single Room Occupancy (SRO) unit is considered a small, affordable housing unit that can serve as an entry point into the housing market for people who previously experienced homelessness. Section 19.16.012 defines Special Needs Housing as “…single room occupancy units, congregate care facilities and similar types of special living arrangements for persons and families who possess extraordinary housing needs by reason of economic, social, mental, or physical disability.” Special Needs Housing is allowed by conditional use permit in all zone districts. The development standards for projects requiring a conditional use permit are specified in the underlying zone district where the project is located, provided that the development standards may be modified or waived by the proposed development plan. The Zoning Ordinance allows for the development of Single Room Occupancy units in all zone districts with a conditional use permit with the possibility of standards being modified or waived. 
Transitional and Supportive Housing 
Section 19.16.012 of the City’s Zoning Ordinance defines Transitional Housing as, “…buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months”, in compliance with state law. The use is permitted in both the single-family and multi-family residential zone districts by-right, treated the same as permitted residential uses without specific restrictions, except for the PRD (Planned Residential Development) zoning district. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to allow for transitional housing by-right in the PRD zoning district. The Zoning Ordinance does not contain “Supportive Housing” as a residential use type. The lack of a residential use type and definition for Supportive Housing could present a constraint to its development in the city. The Zoning Ordinance will be updated to contain Supportive Housing as a defined residential use type and allow for it in the residential zone districts that allow multi-family development and the use can only be subject to the standards and restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone in compliance with Government Code §65583 and §65650, as well as establishing that any Supportive Housing development within a half-mile of public transit cannot establish minimum parking requirements, in compliance with AB 2162. See Program 3. 
Urban Dwelling Units 
In response to the passage of Senate Bill 9 (SB 9), allowing for duplexes on parcels zoned for single-family dwellings, the City of Buellton approved an ordinance that dictates the specific zoning districts this legislation applies to along with development standards including setbacks, height, and parking which are in conformance with SB 9. The City has also included design standards for exterior cladding, windows, and roofs. In accordance with SB 9, jurisdictions are allowed to implement contextual design standards as along as the standards do not prevent the structure from being approved. The ordinance and its associated standards do not present a constraint to the development of housing. 
Urban Lot Splits 
In conjunction with allowing for Urban Dwelling Units, the City has also approved an ordinance allowing for Urban Lot Splits, in accordance with SB 9. The City has also included design standards for building orientation, primary entryways, driveways, and lighting. The City’s ordinance and associated standards do not present a constraint to the development of housing.  
e. Housing for Persons with Disabilities 
The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Sections 5115 and 5116) of the California Welfare and Institutions Code declares that mentally and physically disabled persons are entitled to live in normal residential surroundings. This classification includes facilities that are licensed by the State of California to provide permanent living accommodations and 24 hour primarily non-medical care and supervision for persons in need of personal services, supervision, protection, or assistance for sustaining the activities of daily living. It includes hospices, nursing homes, convalescent facilities, and group homes for minors, persons with disabilities, and people in recovery from alcohol or drug addictions. The use of property as a licensed residential care facility for the care of six or fewer persons is considered a residential use that is permitted in all residential zones. No local agency can impose stricter zoning or building and safety standards on these homes than otherwise required for homes in the same district. 
Persons with disabilities normally have a number of housing needs that include accessibility of dwelling units; access to transportation, employment, and commercial services; and alternative living arrangements that include on-site or nearby supportive services. The City of Buellton ensures that new housing developments comply with California building standards (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations) and federal requirements for accessibility. 
As displayed in Table H-31, Residential Care Homes (six or fewer clients and seven or more clients) are permitted uses. Consistent with state law, facilities with six or fewer persons are permitted by-right in zones that allow residential uses. Alternatively, residential care homes with seven or more persons are subject to minor conditional use permit approval in the RS, RM, and PRD zoning districts and are subject to a Development Permit in the MHP zoning district. The findings required for approval of a minor and conditional use permit are the general findings applied to all minor and conditional use permit approvals. One particular finding requires neighborhood compatibility, which could potentially constrain the development of Residential Care Homes beyond what is required for similar residential development types. This finding is listed below: 
• That the project will not be detrimental to the health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the neighborhood and will be compatible with the surrounding area; 


The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to include Residential Care Homes, Seven or More Clients as a Specific Use in Chapter (19.06) and the use will only be subject to the objective findings of the minor use permit. See Program 3.g. 
In addition, the definition in Chapter 19.12 (Definitions) of “Family” is “...one or more persons occupying premises and living as a single nonprofit housekeeping unit, as distinguished from a group occupying a boarding or lodging house, hotel, club, or similar dwelling for group use. A family shall not include a fraternal, religious, social, or business group. A family shall be deemed to include domestic servants employed by the family.” The Zoning Ordinance’s definition does not 
limit the household size or define the relationship between household members and therefore the definition does not constrain the development of housing.  
Reasonable Accommodation 
The City does not have an ordinance providing reasonable accommodation under federal and state fair housing laws. A reasonable accommodation process is meant to aid the development and use of housing for people with disabilities in making accommodations to land use and zoning decisions and procedures regulating the siting, funding, and development of housing. A reasonable accommodation ordinance creates a process for requesting reasonable accommodation to local policies and processes and establishing the reviewing authority as well as the findings that must be made. This Housing Element includes a program to adopt a reasonable accommodation ordinance. See Program 3. 
Incentives for Affordable Housing 
• Density Bonus – Section 19.16.018 (Density Bonus) provides incentives for very low income, low income, moderate income, and qualifying residents. These provisions for affordable housing bonuses and concessions were adopted in 2006, and the California Density Bonus Law has been changed substantially since 2006, including recent amendments that allow up to 50% density bonus (AB 2345). Section 19.16.018 (Density Bonus) will be updated to reflect current state law. See Program 3. 

• Inclusionary Housing Ordinance – Section 19.16.014 (Inclusionary zoning) provides the standards and provisions for the City’s inclusionary housing ordinance. Adopted in 2002, the ordinance stipulates that all residential and residential mixed-use projects are subject to a minimum requirement of 15% of the units to be made affordable or that an in-lieu fee be paid, or a combination of both. City sponsored projects must provide 30% of the units as affordable. The ordinance also provides additional alternatives to constructing affordable units as part of a residential project such as a dedication of vacant land, construction of affordable units on another site, substantial rehabilitation of existing substandard dwelling, and acquisition and enforcement of rental/sales price restrictions on existing standard dwelling units. These alternatives may be approved by the City Council, if they determine that such an alternative is necessary due to economic hardship or physical constraints that render on-site construction infeasible or if it will further affordable housing opportunities in the city to an equal or greater extent than payment of the Housing In-Lieu Fee.  


The ordinance also requires affordable units to be comparable in terms of number of bedrooms, exterior appearance, and overall quality of construction to non-restricted units. The square footage and interior features in affordable units may not be the same as or equivalent to those in non-restricted units, so long as they are of good quality and are consistent with contemporary standards for new housing. Lastly, affordable units should be dispersed throughout the residential project or may be clustered upon the approval of a development plan that furthers affordable housing opportunities. 
The inclusionary housing ordinance does not present a constraint to the development of housing. 
• Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) – Section 19.16.013 (Affordable housing overlay zone (AHOZ)) provides the development standards and application process for the City’s Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ). The City’s 2005 General Plan and 2009 Housing Element first called for the establishment of an affordable housing overlay zone as its principle means of accommodating the City’s regional share of housing needs for persons and families of low and moderate incomes. The AHOZ consists of nine development sites disbursed through the city which are zoned for commercial or industrial development. The Overlay Zone allows for these sites to be development exclusively for residential use despite what the underlying zone permits. All sites utilizing the Overlay Zone provisions must have a minimum of 20% of the units be affordable to individuals and families of very low, low, and moderate incomes based on the Area Median Income of Santa Barbara County.  


A residential development on an AHOZ site must adhere to the following development standards: 
• Minimum density of 25 units per acre of net buildable area 

• 20% of all units must be affordable. 

• Affordable units may be rental or for-sale dwellings . Should be comparable in number of bedrooms, exterior appearance and overall quality of construction to non-restricted units; 

. May have less square footage and interior amenities to those of non-restricted units in the same residential project, so long as they are of good quality and are consistent with contemporary standards for new housing; and 

. May be clustered or disbursed within the residential project. 




• All residential projects shall comply with the adopted Community Design Guidelines, provided such guidelines are not unreasonably imposed as to render a project infeasible. Furthermore, discretionary authority under a development plan or CUP shall not be unreasonably exercised to impose standards or criteria for the purpose of rendering infeasible the development of housing for any and all economic segments of the community as prohibited in Section 65913.2 of the California Government Code.  

• An Affordable Housing Agreement is required. 

• A density bonus of two market rate units for each low or very low income affordable unit, up to 50% above the base density is allowed. 

• If the mandatory findings of Section 19.16.013.B.10 can be made, the City Council may allow dedication of vacant land or payment of a housing in-lieu fee instead of the construction of affordable units. 



Applications for development of AHOZ sites are subject to the following approval processes: 
• Zoning Clearance: Residential projects conforming to the following criteria shall be allowed by zoning clearance under the jurisdiction of the Planning Director as provided in Sections 19.02.110 (Residential zone allowable land use and permit requirements) and 19.08.100 (Zoning clearance) of this code: (i) the Residential project consists of no more than twenty-five (25) units per acre (inclusive of density bonus units) on sites with an underlying zone district of general commercial (CR) or residential multi-family (RM); and (ii) the physical attributes of design conform to the development standards of the underlying zone district (i.e., building height, lot coverage, setbacks) and adopted community design guidelines of the City. 

• Development Plan: Residential projects greater than twenty-five (25) units per acre (or do not otherwise qualify for a zoning clearance) on AHOZ Sites with an underlying zone district of CR or RM may be allowed by development plan approval under the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission as provided in Sections 19.02.110 (Residential zone allowable land use and permit requirements) and 19.08.120 (Development plans) of the Buellton Municipal Code. The physical attributes of design shall conform to the development standards of the underlying zone district (i.e., building height, lot coverage, setbacks) and adopted community design guidelines of the city except or unless a modification is granted under the provisions of Section 19.08.130(G)(1) of this Code. 

• Conditional Use Permit: Residential projects on AHOZ sites zoned single-family residential (RS), commercial service (CS), open space (OS), or industrial (M) may be allowed by conditional use permit approval under the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission as provided in Sections 19.02.110 (Residential zone allowable land use and permit requirements) and 19.08.110 (Minor and conditional use permits) of the Buellton Municipal Code. The physical attributes of design shall conform to the development standards of the underlying zone district (i.e., building height, lot coverage, setbacks, etc.) and adopted community design guidelines of the City except or unless a development plan is processed concurrent with the conditional use permit and a modification is granted under the provisions of Section 19.08.120(G)(1) of this Code. While a Conditional Use Permit approval requires additional findings to be made which address potential impacts, the approval process is the same as a Development Plan in terms of it being a discretionary approval from the Planning Commission. The Conditional Use Permit approval process does not cause significant delays in comparison to a Development Plan approval. In addition, the required fees for a Conditional Use Permit are substantially similar to a Development Plan. Therefore, the Conditional Use Permit approval process does not increase processing time nor increase the cost of housing in comparison to a Development Plan approval.  



The original AHOZ consisted of nine development sites dispersed through the city that were zoned for commercial or industrial development. Since its inception through 2022, two sites have been constructed with residential projects under the AHOZ ordinance, and produced 106 units, 19 of which are affordable; two other AHOZ projects that were entitled in 2022 will produce a total of 138 residential units, 100%* of which will be affordable (*excluding managers units); and one site was developed with a commercial use. As of 2022, the remaining sites are undeveloped and available for development and expected to exceed the City’s RHNA during this planning period (see Figure H-1, Available AHOZ Sites (2022)).  
Figure H-1 AHOZ Sites (2022)

While AHOZ projects are intended to comply with the Community Design Guidelines and are to be approved with discretionary authority, the Zoning Ordinance specifically says that neither of these processes shall be unreasonably imposed or exercised as to render the project infeasible. In addition, there are circumstances where projects can be approved by the Planning Director through a ministerial Zoning Clearance process. This codified language ensures that any potential constraints to the approval of affordable housing projects are appropriately mitigated. The City has not denied an AHOZ project application in the most recent planning cycle. A developer can expect reasonable certainty of project approval when all development standards have been met. The creation of the AHOZ program displays the City’s intent and desire to develop affordable housing units and therefore will seek to make project proposals feasible within the approval process. The AHOZ program structure represents a clear and productive means of affordable housing production and does not present a constraint to the development of housing in Buellton. 
f. Building Codes and Their Enforcement 
New construction in Buellton, including additions, must comply with the 2019 California Building Code (CBC). The City of Buellton contracts with Santa Barbara County for their Building and Safety Division to perform building permit review and issuance as well as building inspection services. Currently, Santa Barbara County has not adopted local amendments that would directly affect the cost of housing development.  
Existing residences may be remodeled or expanded provided there are no obvious sanitary or safety hazards, all building code requirements have been met, and the necessary permits have been issued. Additions to existing buildings must comply with current building codes. 
The City has a code enforcement program officer who works with the Planning Department on planning-related cases. The code enforcement program is complaint-based. The City provides a Service Request Form on its website which requires the complainant to identify the location of the problem with an exact address as well as a description of the nature of the problem. These complaints are sent directly to the City’s code enforcement officer. Alternatively, the City provides the code enforcement officer’s phone number as another means of contact. This program ensures that properties within the city comply with all municipal and zoning codes as well as assist with health and safety issues. The City’s complaint-based code enforcement program does not present a constraint to the development of housing. 
g. Fees and Other Exactions 
The City’s permit and development fees are available on the City’s website consistent with Government Code §65940.1(a)(1)(A).

Mixed-Use Fee Reductions (Incentive Program) 
Section 19.18.028 (Incentive Program) dictates that mixed-use projects may receive fee reductions if additional public benefits are included in the project. Park and Traffic fee reductions may be granted by the City Council in one or more of the following areas: 
• Sustainable Design. A project that is certifiable as LEED Gold or Platinum or equivalent may be entitled to a 10 percent reduction in park and traffic fees. A project that receives a LEED Gold or Platinum certification may be entitled to a 15 percent reduction in park and traffic fees. 

• Utility Wires. If existing overhead utility wires that are not adjoining the project’s frontage are placed underground, then the project may be entitled to a ten percent reduction in park and traffic fees. The amount of undergrounding shall be no less than the linear street frontage of the project site.  

• On-Site Child Care. A project that provides on-site child care may be entitled to a five percent reduction in park and traffic fees. First priority shall be given to residents and employees of the building. 

• Public Open Space. If an additional 10 percent of the project area is provided as public open space on the project site or within 500 feet of the project site, then the project may be entitled to a five percent reduction in park and traffic fees. Public open space includes park or plaza areas. 

• Recycled Water/Water Reuse. If a project provides dual plumbing in buildings for the future use of recycled water for toilet flushing, cooling towers, and other appropriate uses or provides on-site gray water or rain waiter collection and reuse facilitates, then the project may be entitled to a five percent reduction in park and traffic fees. • Public Restrooms. If a project provides private restroom facilities that are open to the pubic then the project may be entitled to a ten percent reduction in park and traffic fees. 

• Alternative Public Benefit. The City Council, on the recommendation of the Planning Commission, may consider a currently undefined public benefit as proposed by the applicant that provides a public benefit which is significant and substantially beyond normal requirements so as to warrant the granting of fee reductions.  


The potential fee reductions are intended to incentivize the development of mixed-use projects and therefore are not a constraint to the development of housing.

Cost of Single-Family vs. Multi-Family Housing Fees 
Table H-35 below details the estimated total fees for both single-family and multi-family housing. 
Table H-35 Estimated Total Fee Amounts, Single-Family and Multi-Family Housing (2022) 
Single Family 
 Multi-Family (5-unit building) 
 
$6,734.44 
 $15,166.70  
($3,033.34 per unit) 
 

 
Under the assumption that both the single-family and multi-family are being approved with a zoning clearance and applying the general and per-unit fees, multi-family units are the least costly to develop on a per unit basis while single-family units are the highest cost per unit. Fees that are based on a certain square footage where not included in the totals due to their variable nature. Since affordable housing is more likely to be in multi-family developments, the City’s fees do not present a constraint to the development of housing units in Buellton. 
h. Permits and Procedures 
The time required to process a project varies greatly from one entitlement to another and is directly related to the size and complexity of the proposal, as well as the number of actions or approvals needed to complete the process. Table H-36 identifies approvals and/or permits that could be required for planning entitlements along with their corresponding approval body. It should be noted that each project would have to obtain each permit/approval (e.g., small scale projects consistent with General Plan and zoning standards do not require General Plan Amendments, Zone Changes, or Variances.).

Single-Family Residential Development Processing 
All single-family residential development applications require approval of a Zoning Clearance. A Zoning Clearance requires an administrative approval from the Planning Director. Upon the determination from City staff that the application is deemed complete, an approval can be immediately issued. The processing time associated with a single-family residential development is considered the least time-intensive residential permit process. 
Multi-Family Residential Development Processing 
Multi-family residential development applications require either a Zoning Clearance or a Development Plan, depending on the scope of work. A Zoning Clearance is required for infill projects in the Residential Multi-Family zone and when an existing building is being renovated to accommodate multiple residential units with interior renovations only. Given the low impact of renovating an existing building, the Zoning Clearance approval occurs quickly after an application is deemed complete. In all other circumstances, a Development Plan is required when the proposed development is the first development of a vacant site, it is replacing an existing building or site improvement, it is an additional building on a developed site, or an expansion or alteration of an existing building that was not originally authorized by a Development Plan for the site. A Development Plan is reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission at a public hearing. The processing time of a multi-family development application is largely dependent on the overall responsiveness of the applicant to staff and/or commissioner comments and the outcome of the public hearing and potential continuances. Given the wide timeframe of 4 to 15 months, the processing time is potentially short due to the ability of City staff to work with the applicant to have an application deemed complete and City staff’s ability to get the proposed project on a Planning Commission agenda in a short amount of time. Planning Commission agendas tend to have less than three projects for each meeting, meaning the availability for a new project to get onto an agenda is not difficult. The overall process for multi-family development approval either through a Zoning Clearance or Development Plan is typical for cities in the region and does not present a constraint to their development.  
Mixed-Use Development Processing 
Section 19.18.014 (General requirements) states that a Development Plan (DP) shall be required for all mixed-use developments and the City Council shall be the decision-maker on all mixed-use projects, upon recommendations from the Planning Commission. The city does not have a traditional mixed-use zoning district but it allows for the mix of uses through the combination of two existing zoning districts, such as RM and CR with unique development standards, as displayed in Table H-38 (Mixed-use Development Standards). Because there is no mixed-use zoning district, a mixed-use development approval requires approval from the City Council upon recommendation of the Planning Commission. Section 19.18.016 (Allowable mix of uses) incorporates the table below which shows the allowed mix of uses through the combination of two base zoning districts.

When applying for a mixed-use development, the general requirements for all zoning districts are: 
• The primary use must be consistent with the underlying zoning designation and must be equivalent to fifty (50) percent or greater of the total floor space. 

• Tentative and final or parcel maps shall be required for all mixed-use projects that include the creation of lots, condominiums, stock cooperatives, community apartments, and planned unit developments, both new and conversion. 

• Mixed-use projects along the Avenue of Flags and certain portions of State Highway 246 are also subject to the development standards contained in the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan which has since been superseded by the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan. 

• Mixed-use projects are subject to the design requirements of the Community Design Guidelines. 


The structure of the mixed-use program and its associated requirements is intended to allow for mixed-use development in certain base zones, with a particular focus of allowing for multi-family residential buildings with commercial components. The mixed-use program was utilized for The Hub development (APN 099-090-048), which was approved by the City Council in this planning cycle. The Hub contains 54 multi-family residential units, 46,676 square feet of light industrial space, 28,066 square feet of commercial office space, and a 2,377-square-foot community center. The project was approved without the need for variances or utilization of the State Density Bonus program. The Hub provides an example of a mixed-use development approval that adds residential housing units to the city as well as job opportunities and shows that the development was not constrained by existing standards.  
Zoning Clearance 
A Zoning Clearance is required for any new land use or new development assuming an existing use in conformance with the zoning district. Zoning Clearances tend to be required for lower impact permitted uses in each zoning district. Zoning Clearances are processed by the Planning Director, and most residential use types can be approved via Zoning Clearance depending on the scope and intensity of the project. 
The Zoning Ordinance does present a degree of uncertainty in terms of the lack of specificity for each residential use type that requires a Zoning Clearance and why. While Figure H-2 presents a simple and clear administrative review and approval process, the Zoning Ordinance should provide clarity on the intention of the Zoning Clearance process. Overall, the Zoning Clearance process and processing time do not pose a constraint to the development of housing.

Minor and Conditional Use Permit  
Minor and Conditional Use Permits are typically required for more intensive land uses such as equestrian facilities, manufacturing, and schools. The permits are differentiated by the approving authority despite having the same findings for approval. The Zoning Administrator has jurisdiction over all Minor Use Permits while the Planning Commission has jurisdiction over all Conditional Use Permits. Both permit types require the following findings of approval to be made: 
• That the site for the project is adequate in size, shape, location, and physical characteristics to accommodate the type of use and level of development proposed; 

• That significant environmental impacts are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible; 

• That streets and highways are adequate and properly designed; 

• That there are adequate public services, including, but not limited to, fire protection, water supply, sewage disposal, and police protection to serve the project; 

• That the project will not be detrimental to the health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the neighborhood and will be compatible with the surrounding area; 

• That the project is in conformance with the applicable provisions and policies of this title and the general plan. 


Despite having different approval authorities, the permits are nearly identical in their application require-ments, processes, findings for approval, time limits, and site and design review requirements. Figure H-3 below provides a process flowchart for both permit types. Overall, because the Zoning Ordinance is clear in its processes and procedures, the Minor and Conditional Use Permits do not present a constraint to the development of housing.

Preliminary and Final Development Plan 
The Development Plan process is required for projects allowed by right in their respective zoning districts but because of the location, type, or scale of the project, it is determined that the project requires a more detailed review compared to the zoning clearance process. Section 19.08.120 (Development Plans) stipulates that whenever the land use table in Chapter 19.02 requires development plan approval for a specified land use, a development plan application shall be filed with the department and approved only for the following development types: 
• The first development of a vacant site; or 

• The replacement of an existing building, structure, or site improvement; or 

• The construction of an additional building, structure, or site improvement not authorized by a development plan; or 

• An existing building, structure, or site improvement proposed for expansion or alteration, that was not originally authorized by a development plan.  


Section 19.08.120 (Development Plans) allows for the submission of Preliminary Development Plans as a means of getting feedback on a development proposal prior to getting approval of Final Development Plans, allowing for permits to be issued associated with the approved plan.  
The Final Development Plan process mirrors the Preliminary Development Plan process, but it results in an actual land entitlement. Further, when either the Planning Commission or Planning Director has approved a Preliminary Development Plan, the Planning Director shall review the Final Development Plan for conformance with the Preliminary Development Plan and shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the Final Development Plan, without a public hearing. Both Preliminary and Final Development Plans must make the following findings for approval: 
• That the site for the project is adequate in size, shape, location, and physical characteristics to accommodate the density and intensity of development proposed; 

• That adverse impacts are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible; 

• That streets and highways are adequate and properly designed; 

• That there are adequate public services, including, but not limited to, fire protection, water supply, sewage disposal, and police protection to serve the project; 

• That the project will not be detrimental to the health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the neighborhood and will not be incompatible with the surrounding areas; 

• That the project is in conformance with the applicable provisions and policies of this title and the general plan; 

• That the project will not conflict with any easements required for public access through, or public use of a portion of the property; and 

• That the proposed development is in conformance with the community design guidelines. 


While all Preliminary Development Plans must make these findings mentioned above, Final Development Plans must make them in addition to the following findings that are only meant for Final Development Plans. 
• The plan is in substantial conformity with any approved preliminary or revised preliminary development plan except when the planning commission or director considers a final development plan for which there is no previously approved preliminary development plan. In this case, the planning commission or director may consider the final development plan as both a preliminary and final plan; 

• The plan is in conformance with all applicable provisions and policies of the city general plan and this title; and 

• That the proposed development is in conformance with the community design guidelines. 


The main components of the processes and procedures for both Preliminary and Final Development Plans are explained clearly in Section 19.08.120 (Development Plans). The Final Development Plan process does not present a constraint to the development of housing.

The City is in compliance with the provisions of SB 35 by providing a specific SB 35 Eligibility Application on the Planning Department’s webpage. Applicants intending to invoke SB 35 streamlining and ministerial approval process must fill out the application’s checklist, provide a draft site plan, relevant supporting documentation, and a planning review fee. Applications are reviewed for completeness within 2 weeks. Applications deemed complete are processed within 2 weeks.  
SB 330 (Housing Crisis Act) Preliminary Application 
The City is in compliance with the provisions of SB 330 by providing a specific SB 330 Preliminary Application on the Planning Department’s webpage. Applicants intending to invoke the SB 300 approval process must fill out the application and provide the requisite documentation on the project. In accordance with SB 330, once a preliminary application is submitted, an applicant must provide a full application, with all information required by the city or county, within 180 days. If the local agency determines that full application is incomplete (according to the standard 30-day permit streamlining act process), the applicant must submit all missing information within 90 days 
or else the preliminary application expires. In addition, as part of the City’s planned Zoning Ordinance update, objective design standards for multi-family housing will be created. See Program 3.f.  
i. On and Off-site Improvements 
Chapter 18.10 (Subdivision Improvements, Dedications, and Agreements) dictates specific requirements regarding off-site improvements that must be completed prior to the issuance of a building permit for erecting a new structure. 
The City of Buellton requires that developers complete certain minimum site improvements in conjunction with new housing development. Required improvements include the installation of drainage systems, street trees, undergrounding of public utilities such as electricity or gas, water mains, street lighting and road improvements, all of which are typical for new subdivisions. Specifically, the City’s engineering standards require a 40-foot roadway width for new primary residential streets. With each lane being 20 feet wide, room for the driving lane and on-street parking are provided. A 40-foot roadway width is typical for new subdivisions and do not present a constraint to the development of housing. Overall, the improvements are part of the conditions of approval, typically for subdivisions which require extensive new infrastructure. Compliance and enforcement of these improvement standards are coordinated through the City’s Public Works Department. These standards are typical of many communities and do not adversely affect the provision of affordable housing in Buellton. 
As part of the tentative map approval process, the City requires the dedication of land and/or the payment of fees for park and recreational purposes. The parkland dedication process is enacted as authorized by the provisions of Article 3, Chapter 4 of the Map Act, also known as the Quimby Act. Based on the policies of the parks and recreation element of the general plan, the City requires 0.132 acres of property per dwelling unit be devoted to neighborhood and community park and recreational purposes. The methodology is based on five required park and recreation acres per thousand (1,000) persons, in accordance with the General Plan, and the average city population density of 2.63 persons per dwelling unit as determined by the 1990 Census. The parkland dedication process does not present a constraint to the development of housing. 
2. Environmental Constraints 
The City of Buellton is situated in a valley, along the Santa Ynez River, surrounded by agricultural land. The City’s Safety Element, within the General Plan, identifies certain portions of the city that are within FEMA flood zones, particularly close to the river as well as fire hazard areas on the outer edges of the jurisdiction. The City requires all development to be at least 200 feet from the Santa Ynez Riverbank to avoid the effects of flooding and reduce the threat of landslides along the riverbank. In addition, the City requires all developments to be at least 50 feet from creeks. Buellton is also approximately 7 miles from both the Los Alamos Fault line and the Santa Ynez Fault line. Similar to many jurisdictions throughout California, Buellton is susceptible to flooding, wildfires, and earthquakes. There are no Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones within city limits. The potential environmental hazards in Buellton do not distinguish it from other jurisdictions and do not present a constraint to development.  
3. Market Constraints 
Market factors over which a local government has only limited ability to control can influence the jurisdiction’s capacity to develop more housing. These market-related constraints can include land 
cost, construction cost, and the availability of financing. An assessment of these non-governmental market constraints can inform the development of potential actions that can ameliorate its impact. 
a. Economic Climate 
Regional economic conditions provide the overall context for housing development and availability. An analysis of the relationship of the economy to housing production indicates that a strong economic climate results in an increase in housing production. 
Housing prices have increased steadily after the low of the Great Recession. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused high levels of unemployment and recession in many segments of the market, the housing market has overall been untouched by the pandemic thus far. Throughout 2021, as interest rates have been lowered by the Federal Reserve in response to the pandemic, housing prices have continued to rise. However, the long-term impacts of the pandemic on the economy and the housing market are still unknown. 
b. Timing and Density 
Non-governmental market constraints can include timing between project approval and requests for building permits. In most cases, this may be due to developers’ inability to secure financing for construction. In Buellton, the average time between project approval and request for building permit is typically one to six months, though there may be extenuating circumstances that delay projects for different reasons not in the City’s control. 
As detailed in Section E, Housing Opportunities and Resources, of this Housing Element, development projects in Buellton have been approved with a higher-than-average density, comparable to the allowable density due to the utilization of the California Density Bonus Law, the Development Opportunity Reserve incentive program, and the AHOZ having no maximum density. 
c. Cost of Land 
The two biggest expenses in housing development are land costs and construction costs. Construction costs tend to correlate with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and this remain somewhat consistent. Although construction costs have increased along with the CPI, the cost of land has escalated to the largest item associated with the cost of housing. 
In Buellton, residential land costs vary depending on the availability of land and the cost of grading and infrastructure (off-site improvements) associated with the development of a proposed project. Based on Santa Barbara County Assessor data, the average cost for a typical residential parcel (±7,500 square feet) without improvements is approximately $290,000. The average price of a similarly sized residential parcel without improvements in the adjacent City of Solvang is approximately $375,000. The cost of residential land in Buellton does not present a constraint to the development of housing. 
d. Cost of Construction 
Hard construction costs including the cost of materials (wood, cement, asphalt, roofing, pipe, glass, and other interior materials) and labor comprise more than 60% of total development costs (2022). Materials costs vary depending on the type of housing being constructed and amenities provided. Labor costs are influenced by the availability of workers and prevailing wages. 
According to the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley, affordable and market rate developers have seen increasing construction costs throughout the state. For example, the cost of building a 100-unit affordable project in California increased from $265,000 per unit in 2000 to almost $425,000 in 2016. On a square foot basis, the Terner Center reports that the cost of constructing multi-family housing increased by 25% between 2009 and 2018, reaching an average of $222 per square foot by 2018. This analysis illustrates that construction costs comprise a significant proportion of the ultimate sales price of residential development.  
Prevailing wages may also be an additional constraining on construction costs for affordable housing projects. In California, all public works projects must pay prevailing wages to all workers employed on the project. A public works project is any residential or commercial project that is funded through public funds, including federal funding or assisted residential projects controlled or carried out by an awarding body. The prevailing wage is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft, classification, or type of work within the locality and in the nearest labor market area. A prevailing wage ensures that the ability to get a public works contract is not based on paying lower wage rates than a competitor and requires that all bidders use the same wage rates when bidding on a public works project. Prevailing wages may constrain construction of affordable housing because they are often higher than normal wages. 
e. Availability of Financing 
The availability of financing depends on many factors, including current interest rates and fees, laws and regulations governing financial institutions and lending practices, and the types of lending institutions available within a community. 
For instance, home mortgage rates of the late 1990s and early 2000s were relatively low with 30-year fixed rates as low as 5%. However, the burst of the housing bubble and the Great Recession led to changes in lending practices and regulations. While necessary to prevent predatory lending practices and foreclosures, these changes made it more difficult for lower income households to qualify for standard mortgages. More recently, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates in response to inflation. As of July 2022, interest rates are approximately 6% for a 30-year fixed mortgage.  
Financing for both construction and long-term mortgages is generally available in Buellton subject to normal underwriting standards. However, a more critical impediment to homeownership involves both the affordability of the housing stock and the ability of potential buyers to fulfill down payment requirements. Typically, conventional home loans will require 10% to 20% of the sale price as a down payment, which is the largest constraint to first-time homebuyers.  
 
E. Housing Opportunities and Resources 
Housing resources refer to the land, financial, and administrative resources that are available to meet Buellton’s housing needs to mitigate the housing constraints identified in earlier sections of this Housing Element. This section provides an inventory, analysis, and assessment of the City’s resources to address its housing needs, including the City’s share of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). 
1. Potential for Future Housing 
State housing law requires that each jurisdiction in the state quantify the need for housing within its jurisdiction as part of the periodic process of updating local housing elements of the general plan. As such, the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG) has allocated the City of Buellton housing production goals for the 6th Cycle Housing Element Update. The paragraphs below outline how the City of Buellton will accommodate its share of the regional housing need during the planning period. 
The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) developed and adopted by SBCAG covers the growth projection period from June 30, 2022 through February 15, 2031. The RHNA assigns a housing production number to each jurisdiction in the region. Buellton must identify adequate land with appropriate zoning and development standards to accommodate its allocation of the regional housing need. For the sites analysis, the RHNA allocation is divided into three income categories: Very Low and Low, Moderate, and Above Moderate based on Area Median Income (AMI) levels in the region. Table H-39 outlines that Buellton’s share of regional future housing needs is a total of 165 units between February 15, 2023, and February 15, 2031. This allocation is distributed into the three income categories identified above. The RHNA includes a fair share adjustment that allocates future (construction) need in each income category in a way that meets the state mandate to reduce over-concentration of lower income households in historically lower income communities or areas within the region.

As outlined elsewhere in this document, the City of Buellton has taken affirmative measures to ensure the development of affordable housing in the city. The City actively monitors levels of affordability to ensure the City’s RHNA is met throughout the RHNA process. For the purposes of this analysis, conservative estimates of affordable housing have been provided. All projects with affordability components will require an Affordable Housing Agreement approved by the City Council to specify the exact parameters to be provided. Through this process, the City will require development at certain income levels in conformance with RHNA. 
There are two major categories of sites that combine to meet the City of Buellton’s 6th Cycle RHNA requirement. These include Credits Toward RHNA and sites identified through the Residential Sites Inventory. The following paragraphs outline each of these categories and the City’s ability to meet its RHNA allocation. 
2. Credits Toward RHNA 
Credits toward RHNA include approved Units Built and/or Entitled Since June 30, 2022, Units Pending Approval (Pipeline Projects), and Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) anticipated to be built during the planning period. 
a. Units Built and/or Entitled Since June 30, 2022 
The 6th Cycle RHNA covers an 8-year planning period beginning on February 15, 2023. Housing units built, under construction, or receiving building permits from June 30, 2022 onward can be credited towards meeting the City’s share of the regional housing need and subtracted from the City’s RHNA. Between June 30, 2022 and February 15, 2023, one building permit was issued for an ADU at 243 Glennora Way. As outlined in the pages that follow, ADUs are assumed to fall into the moderate-income category due to their smaller size and the state legislature’s finding that ADUs are an affordable housing type. 
b. Units Pending Approval (Pipeline Projects) 
As of February 15, 2023, fourteen proposed projects totaling 348 units were at various stages of review and approval including projects not yet approved by Planning and projects approved by Planning but not yet approved by Building. These projects include single-family, multi-family, mixed-use and Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). All of the listed items are active projects which are anticipated to be constructed within the 2023-2031 planning cycle. Projects that have been on long-term hold or are otherwise not likely to be developed have not been included in this assessment. In addition, Program 1 obligates the City to conduct a regular review to evaluate the progress of pipeline and other projects to determine whether the City is on track to satisfy its RHNA obligations.If the City falls short of adequate zoning capacity to accommodate the RHNA, within 6 months additional sites will be identified and, if needed, rezoned. 
In terms of assumed income levels for Pipeline projects, affordability levels were based on the actual affordability levels proposed, approved Affordable Housing Agreements where available, and/or the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. As outlined elsewhere in this document, the Inclusionary Ordinance requires that new or substantially rehabilitated units undertaken by a developer provide 15% affordable units, of which 45% must be affordable to very low-income persons or families, 30% must be affordable to low-income persons or families, and 25% must be available to moderate income persons or families based on 6th Cycle Net RHNA goals. Developers may opt to pay an inclusionary housing fee in lieu of providing units on site. However, the payment of in-lieu fees is discouraged and requires approval by the City. 
Table H-40 below outlines the projects pending approval in the City of Buellton as of February 15, 2023, and the following paragraphs provide a detailed description of the bigger projects.

Ballard Canyon Project – This project consists of a proposal for one single-family dwelling and one ADU proposed on Ballard Canyon Road at the City’s northeastern border. As of February 15, 2023, the project is under review by the City and the applicant intends to construct the project within the 6th planning cycle. The applicant will pay the in-lieu inclusionary fee for the single-family dwelling which will fall into the above-moderate income level based on market value. Due to the factors outlined under “Accessory Dwelling Units” below, the ADU has been categorized in the moderate-income category. 
Buellton Garden Apartments (AHOZ Site IX) – Buellton Garden Apartments is an 89-unit multi-family residential project planned on the east side of Highway 101 at the City’s southern border. The project has received discretionary entitlements and is undergoing construction plans review. As a tax credit project, the project includes 88 very-low/low-income units, including 16 extremely-low- income units, and 1 above-moderate manager’s unit. Based on the input from the applicant, and timelines associated with the approved tax credits, the project will be constructed within the 6th planning cycle. 
Buellton Hub – Buellton Hub is a mixed light industrial/multi-family residential project planned in the south-central quadrant of the City. The project has received discretionary approvals and is undergoing construction plans review. The project is conditioned to meet the City’s 15% inclusionary housing requirements by providing 8 affordable units within the 54-unit residential portion of the project which are projected to include 6 very-low/low and 2 moderate-income units. The exact income breakdown of the 8 units will be determined upon execution of an Affordable 
Housing Agreement and will be based on the City’s progress in meeting the 6th Cycle RHNA allocation at the time. The project is expected to be constructed early in the 6th planning cycle.  
Creekside Village – Creekside Village is a mixed-use retail/residential project within the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan. Development entitlements and a development agreement were approved in 2020 and the project was conditioned to comply with the 15% inclusionary housing requirement by providing 10 affordable units on-site which are projected to include 7 very low/low-income and 3 moderate-income units. The exact income breakdown of the 10 units will be determined upon execution of an Affordable Housing Agreement and will be based on the City’s progress in meeting the 6th Cycle RHNA allocation at the time. Development of the project stalled during the COVID pandemic but it is the developer’s intent to move forward and complete the project within the 6th planning cycle.  
La Lata Court – La Lata Court is a proposed single family and ADU development on a 1.9-acre lot. The project went through a Planning Commission Preliminary Review process in 2021, is currently in the entitlement process, and is expected to be permitted and constructed within the 6th Cycle. The project includes 11 single-family homes each with an attached ADU. Of the 11 single-family homes, the property owner is proposing to provide two very low/low-income units meet the City’s 15% inclusionary requirement. 
Polo Village (AHOZ Site IV) – Polo Village is a planned affordable housing project located at 560 McMurray Road. The project was approved ministerially under the SB 35 entitlement process. In 2022, the City Council approved an Affordable Housing Agreement for the project which will include 1 manager’s unit and 48 very low/low-income affordable units, including 15 extremely low-income units. The units will serve as replacement units for motel rooms on Avenue of Flags which have been serving as single room occupancy (SRO) units and will be converted back to motel units. At the time of preparation of this document, the project is undergoing construction plans review and is expected to be developed within the first half of the planning cycle.  
Central Avenue Duplexes and ADUs. This is a proposed multi-family residential project located at 430 and 440 Central Avenue that will include 4 multi-family residential units and 2 ADUs, one of which will be restricted to very low/low-income to meet the 15% inclusionary requirement. The project has received discretionary entitlements, is undergoing construction plans review, and is expected to be developed within the 6th Cycle. 
The 518. The 518 is a planned mixed-use retail and multi-family residential project at 518 Avenue of Flags which has received discretionary entitlements and is undergoing construction plans review at the time of preparation of this document. The multi-family component includes 48 residential units. Based on an Affordable Housing Agreement approved by the City Council in October 2022, the applicant will pay the in lieu inclusionary housing fee rather than providing affordable units on-site. The project is anticipated to be developed within the first half of the planning cycle. 
Village Senior Apartments. This project is an approved 50-unit affordable senior-restricted housing project. The project has received entitlements and is utilizing tax credits to provide 49 very low-income affordable units and one manager’s unit. The project is undergoing construction plans review as of February 15, 2023 and is expected to be constructed in the first half of the planning cycle. 
A Note about Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) units: As outlined in Section C, Housing Needs Assessment, the City anticipates that 41 SRO units in the city will be lost between 2023 and 2031 as 
the owners of three motels in the city convert their affordable SRO units back to short-term rental “motel” units. The City will work with property owners to offer SRO occupants affordably priced rental units at two of the projects identified in Table H-40 above: the Creekside Village and Polo Village projects. Thus, SRO occupants will not be adversely affected by the anticipated conversion in these units. However, to account for the relocation of SRO residents and avoid double-counting, 41 housing units have been deducted from the totals outlined in Table H-40. In addition, to provide the most conservative estimate, all of the SRO units are assumed to be occupied by very low income residents and are thus deducted from that category. 
c. Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) and Junior Accessory Dwelling Units (JADUs) 
As previously identified, ADUs are units with complete independent living facilities for one or more persons built on the same lot as, or attached to, a primary residence. JADUs are ADUs that are up to 500 square feet in size and are located entirely within a single-family dwelling unit. To promote ADUs as a means of providing affordable infill housing, the State of California has enacted several laws since 2017 to streamline the ADU permitting process and reduce restrictions on ADUs. The City of Buellton has modified its development regulations to meet state require-ments and has experienced a corresponding increase in ADU activity. While no ADUs were permitted or completed in 2017 or 2018, one ADU was completed in 2019 and three were permitted and/or completed in both 2020 and 2021. In addition, five ADUs were being processed by the City in 2022/2023. Based on these trends, the City has made a conservative estimate that a minimum of two ADUs will be permitted and/or constructed in each year of the 2023-2031 planning cycle for a total of 16 projected ADU units during the 6th Cycle. This Housing Element includes a program (Program 2) to encourage the development of ADUs by updating the City’s ADU ordinance, monitoring state ADU legislation, and promoting ADUs on the City’s web page. In an effort to ascertain average ADU rental rates in the City, a survey of ADU rental rates was attempted but no ADU rentals were found on rental search engines (i.e., www.rentcafe.com) for Buellton or surrounding areas. Due to their small size relative to the primary residence they’re combined with, ADUs are likely to fall into the very low/low or moderate-income categories. In addition, the state’s legislation on ADUs has found them to be an affordable form of housing. Nonetheless, in the absence of comparable data and to provide a conservative estimate of affordability, ADUs were assumed to fall into the moderate-income category for the purpose of this analysis. 
d. Remaining RHNA 
As outlined in Table H-41, after accounting for units built or entitled since June 30, 2022, pipeline projects and anticipated ADUs, the City fully meets its 6th Cycle RHNA allocation with a surplus of 200 units. Nonetheless, to fully evaluate its housing capacity, and provide a greater buffer in the event that one or more of the identified projects are not built, the City has conducted a residential sites inventory, as outlined in the following section.

3. Residential Sites Inventory 
a. Methodology 
State law requires cities and counties to identify vacant and underutilized sites that can accommodate a portion of the jurisdiction’s RHNA. These may include vacant and underutilized sites with zoning designations that allow residential development and that are likely to develop within the planning period. Jurisdictions are not required to build housing; rather, they must ensure there are adequate sites with appropriate zoning designations to accommodate the City’s RHNA. 
As outlined below, there are two major categories of sites in the City of Buellton that make up the Residential Sites Inventory. These include Affordable Housing Overlay (AHOZ) sites, and vacant residential sites. 
b. Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) Sites 
As previously identified, the AHOZ was adopted in 2005 as the City’s principal means of accommodating its regional housing needs for persons and families with low and moderate incomes. Development within each AHOZ site will be required to obtain an Affordable Housing Agreement with the City to outline specific affordability parameters. At a minimum, each project will be required to provide 20% of the units as affordable. Of these, 45% must be affordable to very low-income persons or families, 30% must be affordable to low-income persons or families, and 25% must be available to moderate income persons or families based on 6th Cycle Net RHNA goals.  
From the inception of AHOZ through 2022, two projects (Sites V and X) have taken advantage of the overlay and produced 106 units, 19 of which are affordable (refer to Figure H-1). One and one-half sites (Site XI and a portion of Site IX) have been developed with commercial uses. In addition, as outlined above under Pipeline Projects, two projects (Site IV and the remaining portion of Site IX) are in the approval process and anticipated to produce a total of 138 residential units, 100%* of which will be affordable (*excluding a manager’s unit). The remaining four sites, Sites I, II, III, and VII, are undeveloped or underdeveloped and are available for development. Based on the historical performance of the AHOZ, the location of each site, and developer interest to date, one of these sites (Site II) is expected to be developed with 100% residential uses and one site (Site VII) is expected to be developed with mixed residential and commercial uses. The potential for residential development on AHOZ Sites I and III is a bit more speculative and thus no residential development has been assumed for those sites within the 6th Cycle planning period. A detailed assessment of each site is provided below. 
• AHOZ Site I includes 17.10 acres located immediately east of Highway 101 and McMurray Road, north of Los Padres Way. The site is part of a larger area in the northeastern quadrant of the City designated for industrial development. The site has been operating as a horse care, boarding facility and forage production operation for several years. Land uses surrounding the site include farming and ranching operations outside the City of Buellton to the north and east. To the south are various commercial and industrial uses including a collision repair center, recycling center, towing operation, and wine tasting room. To the west are McMurray Road and the freeway. Due to its location within an industrial, commercial and agricultural hub, the existing uses on the site are expected to remain or convert to uses similar to those in the surrounding area. As such, the site is not expected to be developed with residential uses within the 2023-2031 planning period. 

• AHOZ Site II contains a 15.0-acre strip of land on the west side of Highway 101 and Jonata Park Road at the city’s northern border that has been used for residential and animal-keeping uses. The property is designated General Commercial on the General Plan land use map, is primarily vacant and contains a small, older single-family home, a trailer, and various out buildings. Although surrounded on the immediate north, west, and south by vacant land, Jonata Park Road connects the site to residential development to the north and south within and outside the City of Buellton. In addition, various developers have approached the City about the possibility of developing residential uses on the site, including a prior proposal for a continuing care residential facility. Due to these factors, Site II is considered very likely to be developed with 100% residential uses under the provisions of AHOZ and has been assumed for residential development within this Housing Element. Based on the AHOZ minimum density of 25 du/ac, the site is projected to develop with a total of 375 units, including 56 very low/low-income units, 19 moderate-income units and 300 above moderate units. 

• AHOZ Site III is a vacant 3.20-acre elongated site located on an island of land between Highway 101 and McMurray Road, north of R.T. Buell Drive. The site is designated and zoned for general commercial uses. Land uses surrounding the site include roadways, vacant land and commercial and light industrial development to the east and west. Based on general interest in residential and commercial development in the City, staff believes the site will develop in the next eight years with either commercial or residential development, However, because residential development at this location is uncertain, no units have been assumed in this Housing Element. 

• AHOZ Site VII includes six parcels of land located at the southeast corner of Avenue of Flags and Highway 246, west of Highway 101 within the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan. Most of the parcels are vacant, although a used car dealer and parking lots are located along the Avenue of Flags frontage. In addition, a vacant and abandoned single-family dwelling unit is present on the Highway 246 frontage. The Avenue of Flags Specific Plan calls for mixed residential and commercial development on the site. In addition, the City has received recent inquiries regarding the feasibility of developing this area with mixed uses. Due to these factors, AHOZ Site VII is expected to develop as a mixed-use residential and commercial project between 2023-2031 with 50% residential uses. This would result in the development of 14 units on the site based on the base density requirement, including 2 very low/low-income units, 1 moderate-income unit, and 11 above moderate units.  


Although it is likely that one or more of the sites will achieve densities in excess of 25 du/ac through the density bonus provision, or through the City’s Development Opportunity Reserve (DOR) incentive program, additional density has not been assumed in order to provide a conservative estimate.  
In addition, Sites II and VII are anticipated to be developed as outlined above; however, the potential exists for one or both of the sites to be built out with non-residential development. Although this is considered unlikely, the City will fully meet its RHNA with the Credits Toward RHNA outlined earlier in this section and the loss of one or both AHOZ sites would not impact the City’s ability to meet RHNA. Nonetheless, the City will continue to monitor the RHNA on a regular basis and will make adjustments to the project affordability requirements mid-cycle if needed, as outlined in Program 1.  
In addition, site II and VII have been fully evaluated pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and development on these sites would not have any potentially significant environmental impacts. Table H-42 below outlines the residential development expected to occur on Sites II and VII during the 2023-2031 planning period.

c. Vacant and Underutilized Residential Sites 
The City of Buellton conducted a citywide inventory of vacant and underutilized sites to identify additional development that is likely to occur during the 2023-2031 planning period. The inventory built upon the sites inventory conducted for the 5th Cycle Housing Element Update, removed sites that were entitled or unlikely to develop, and examined whether any additional vacant residential sites could be added to the inventory for the production of housing. This analysis resulted in the identification of two vacant and/or underutilized residential sites in the city. 
Table H-42 above outlines the remaining residential development expected to occur on the vacant and underutilized residential sites identified by the sites inventory. 
1. Due to development interest in the city and the shortage of vacant residential sites, the remaining sites are expected to build out during the 2023-2031 planning period. 
2. Because the remaining sites could each accommodate fewer than 10 units, a conservative assumption has been made that development would pay the in-lieu fee rather than providing affordable units on-site, and the sites have been categorized as “above moderate-income.” 
3. To provide a conservative estimate of potential development, it was assumed that development will occur at 70% of the maximum density allowed by the zone. 
The vacant and underutilized residential sites identified through the sites inventory contains no environmental constraints, and all required infrastructure for wet and dry utilities is available and can easily be connected to development via existing mains in the public right-of-way. The services and infrastructure are in place and capable of providing water and sewer to serve new residential development on the site. In addition, there is sufficient water, sewer, and dry utility capacity to accommodate development. 
It should be noted that a few of the vacant commercially zoned sites in the city could be developed with a mix of residential and commercial development. In particular, the Mixed Use Ordinance and the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan could accommodate up to 326 multi-family units as part of future mixed-use development at build-out. In addition, there are other underutilized residential, commercial, and industrially zoned sites in the city that may be intensified or redeveloped with residential or mixed-use development over time. However, the likelihood of additional mixed-use projects being developed within the planning period is speculative and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. As such, these sites have not been included in the Residential Sites Inventory. 
Environmental Constraints 
As outlined in the General Plan Safety Element, the primary environmental issues affecting the City of Buellton are flooding, dam inundation, seismic activity and wildland fires. These constraints are described in more detail in the following paragraphs, particularly as they affect the housing sites identified above. It should be noted that this analysis does not reference CalEnviroScreen 4.0 because that mapping tool provides a pollution assessment for a larger census tract and is more reflective of conditions in the rural unincorporated area north of the City of Buellton. 
Flooding. The Santa Ynez River flows through the southern portion of the City in and east to west direction with three tributary creeks, Thumbelina Creek, Zaca Creek and Petersen Creek, also flowing through the City. All three waterways can experience overflow during storm events although flooding events have decreased over time due to ongoing storm drain improvements and cleaning. In terms of specific sites, five pipeline projects and one AHOZ site (Site VII) are located in the 100-year floodplain and one ADU site is located within the 500-year floodplain. Buellton’s Floodplain Ordinance requires all new buildings to be built at least 200 feet from the top of bank of the Santa Ynez River and all new buildings must be constructed a minimum of 2 feet above the flood zone. In addition, during the review process for projects in these areas, the City’s Public Works Department will require hydraulic and hydrologic studies to demonstrate the projects will be protected from flooding and not create upstream impacts. With these requirements and the incorporation of any identified mitigation measures identified through the review process, projects in these areas would not be impacted by flooding events. 
Dam Inundation. Although considered unlikely, the City of Buellton could also experience flooding in the event of failure of the Bradbury Dam 12 miles upstream on Lake Cachuma. Flooding would occur in the area south of Highway 246 and in the southeastern quadrant of the City. Four pipeline project sites, three ADU sites and AHOZ Site VII could potentially be affected by dam inundation. However, the potential for dam failure and resultant flooding are considered extremely unlikely and the identified sites would not be any more likely to be affected that existing development in the area. Thus, dam inundation is not considered to be a constraint to development. 
Seismic Activity. Like most of California, Santa Barbara County is an active seismic region and moderate to strong ground shaking occurs periodically in the area. There are no known faults in the City; however, the Santa Ynez and the Los Alamos Faults are located approximately 7 miles to the south. In addition, the San Andreas Fault is located approximately 50 miles northwest of the City. The City of Buellton, and the housing sites identified in this Housing Element, will likely experience ground shaking from future earthquake events. However, this potential is not unique to the sites or the City, and all development proposals will be reviewed and conditioned appropriately to mitigate the effects of seismic shaking. As such, the potential for seismic activity is not considered to be a constraint to development on the identified sites. 
Wildland Fires. Santa Barbara County’s climate and terrain make it susceptible to wildfires. In order to assist with wildfire planning, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) has created Fire Hazard Severity Zone (FHSZ) maps to identify where wildfires are most likely to occur. There are no Moderate, High, or Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in the City and none of the identified housing sites would be especially prone to wildfire hazards. 
Other Site Constraints. In addition to the environmental constraints outlined above, there are no other known constraints that could impede the development of the sites identified in this Housing Element. All of the sites are comprised of one or more legal buildable lots of adequate size and configuration to accommodate development. In addition, all of the sites are relatively flat, are vacant or minimally developed, and are not located adjacent to existing or planned land uses that would be incompatible with residential development. Finally, none of the sites are contaminated or contain other known constraints. 
Availability of Site Infrastructure and Services  
All sites identified in the inventory are located within urbanized areas where infrastructure and public services are readily available. Water service is provided by the City of Buellton through the Central Coast Water Authority (CCWA). The City’s potable water is derived primarily from groundwater with supplementation from the State Water Project. As a small city, Buellton is not required to prepare its own Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) but is part of the CCWA’s UWMP which is updated regularly. The UWMP documents water needs and supplies and demonstrates there will be adequate supplies to meet future water needs. To aid in preparing the UWMP and forecasting how much water will be needed in the future, member agencies such as Buellton provide build-out assumptions based on the General Plan and other land use policies and regulations. As all the sites identified within this Housing Element are consistent with these documents, it can be concluded there will be adequate water supplies to support development 
The City of Buellton also provided wastewater service in the City. As required by state law, the City updates its Sewer System Management Plan (SSMP) every 5 years to plan, manage, operate, and maintain all parts of the system. Improvements needed to operate the system and accommodate growth projected by the City’s land use policies and regulations are programed into the system. As the housing sites identified in this Housing Element are consistent with the City’s land use documents, wastewater services and facilities will be adequate to serve future development on these sites. 
As the City’s water and sewer provider, the Public Works Department has received each draft of the 6th Cycle Housing Element to inform them of future housing needs in the City and ensure that water and sewer service will be available to serve new development. In addition, pursuant to Government Code §65589.7, the City will establish specific procedures to grant priority water and 
sewer service to developments with units affordable to lower-income households as outlined in Program 4, Action Item 4.e. 
4. Progress in Meeting Housing Needs 
Table H-43 below summarizes Buellton’s progress in meeting the 6th Cycle RHNA and its capacity for housing development. Overall, the City has the existing capacity needed to accommodate its RHNA in all income categories with a combined surplus of 596 dwelling units. Figure H-5, Adequate Housing Sites Map illustrates all of the City’s housing sites that combine to meet and exceed the City’s RHNA.

5. Financial Resources 
a. SB 2/LEAP/REAP Grants 
In 2017, Governor Jerry Brown signed a 15-bill housing package aimed at addressing the state’s housing shortage and high housing costs. The package included the Building Homes and Jobs Act (SB 2, 2017), which established a $75 recording fee on real estate documents to increase the supply of affordable homes in California. The funding was made available until the beginning of March 2019 to update planning documents and land-use ordinances to streamline and promote the development of housing. The City of Buellton did not apply for or receive SB 2 funds during the first cycle of the grant program. 
For the second year and onward, 70% of SB 2 funding will be allocated to local governments for affordable housing purposes. A large portion of Year Two allocations will be distributed using the same formula used to allocate federal Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). Year Two affordable housing funds will be available for: 
• Increasing the supply of housing for households at or below 60% of AMI 

• Increasing assistance to affordable owner-occupied workforce housing 

• Assisting persons experiencing or at risk of homelessness 

• Facilitating housing affordability, particularly for lower and moderate-income households 

• Promoting projects and programs to meet the local government’s unmet share of regional housing needs allocation 


Another source of funding to help local jurisdictions update their planning documents and implement process improvements that will facilitate housing construction is the Local Early Action Planning (LEAP) program. The City received $65,000 in LEAP grants in 2020 for the 6th Cycle Housing Element Update and related tasks, including the establishment of pre-approved plans for ADUs and greater electronic review of plans. LEAP funds are not expected to be offered again in the future. 
A third source of funding available to local jurisdictions is the Regional Early Action Grant Program (REAP). Allocated regionally, jurisdictions are eligible for funding through their regional councils of government (COGs) or other regional organizations for planning efforts related to the production of housing. In 2020 the City of Buellton received $126,794 in REAP 1.0 funds through SBCAG for consultant costs associated with the Housing Element Update. A second round of REAP funding (REAP 2.0) has been allocated and will be available through regional planning agencies beginning in 2022. 
b. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) 
The City of Buellton is eligible to receive Community Development Block Grant funding annually through the Urban County Program. Santa Barbara County was deemed an urban county in 2007. Under the Urban County Program, member jurisdictions are entitled to annual CDBG allotments directly through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The program is administered for the City by the County of Santa Barbara. A portion of these proceeds are available for affordable housing projects and public facilities serving low-income residents, including new housing construction, ownership and rental rehabilitation, infrastructure improvements and the provision of public facilities and services for low- income residents. The balance of this funding can be utilized for economic development and planning activities. This is a competitive program, requiring the preparation of an annual application to the state in response to a request for proposals (RFP). 
c. Housing Choice Vouchers 
The Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara (HASBARCO) administers the federally funded Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCV) for Buellton residents. This housing voucher program (also known as Section 8 housing) provides rental subsidies to lower and moderate-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities to assist them in securing safe and decent housing in the private market. Voucher recipients generally pay between 30% and 40% of their adjusted monthly gross income in rent. The voucher program is a long-standing, federally funded program but is not expected to increase in size or scope in the future. Nonetheless, it remains an important affordable housing program in the City of Buellton by helping to balance a household’s income and the cost of housing. 
d. Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) 
The Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), similar to CDBG, is a formula-based block grant program funded through HUD. Federal HOME funds can be used for a variety of activities that promote affordable rental housing and homeownership for low and very low-income households. Funds may be used for building acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer assistance, and tenant-based assistance. Grant recipients must provide a local match ranging between 25% and 50% depending on program activity. To enhance their prospects for funding, the cities of Buellton, Carpinteria, 
Goleta, Lompoc, Santa Maria, and Solvang have formed a consortium cooperation with Santa Barbara County. Since forming this alliance, the HOME Consortium has succeeded in securing funds in each of the annual application cycles since 1999. 
6. Administrative Resources 
The City of Buellton actively works with a number of non-profit organizations and affordable housing developers to expand and preserve affordable housing in the city. The following non-profit agencies are either actively providing or preserving affordable housing in the city or in the San Barbara County. These include: 
• People’s Self Help Housing Corporation (PSHHC): a non-profit affordable housing organization with a mission to build affordable homes and provide housing services to communities. They serve low-income households, families, farmworkers, seniors, and veterans. 

• Santa Barbara Housing Trust Fund (HTF): a non-profit financing initiative whose mission is to expand affordable housing opportunities for low-to-middle income residents and workers of Santa Barbara County. 

• Tri-Counties Community Housing Corporation (TCCHC): a non-profit organization that enhances the quality of life for people with developmental disabilities by creating quality affordable housing options in inclusive communities. 

• Habitat for Humanity of Southern Santa Barbara: a non-profit organization that helps individuals and families build and improve a place to call home.  

• Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation: a non-profit organization that provides affordable housing to individuals and families lacking in opportunity in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. 

• Palm Communities: an affordable housing developer in Southern California specializing in affordable housing for families, seniors and those with special needs. 


a. Opportunities for Energy Conservation 
The California Government Code §65583(a)(8) requires “[a]n analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential development.” 
The Santa Barbara County’s Climate Action Plan, which was adopted in 2015, sets a goal to reduce emissions to 15% below baseline 2007 levels. Consumers in Santa Barbara are encouraged to consider installing on-site renewable energy generation operations such as solar, solar + battery storage. In addition, consumers can join Central Coast Community Energy program, which provides electricity generated by clean and renewable sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. 
b. Water Conservation 
The City adopted a Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance pursuant to California Government Code §65595, which regulates the efficient use of water resources (Buellton Municipal Code 13.72.020). In 2014, the City of Buellton adopted Resolution 14-19, declaring a Stage Two Water Conservation Requirement. This is pursuant to the State Water Resources Control Board’s regulations declaring a State of Emergency due to severe drought conditions. Residents and businesses are required to reduce water consumption and limit outdoor irrigation to meet these requirements. 
The City of Buellton has a landscape rebate program “Buellton Beautiful” to encourage residents, business tenants, and property owners to convert their front yard landscape to a drought tolerant landscape. Those who participate in the rebate program can get $2.00 per square foot for replacing their lawns with water-efficient plants, xeriscape, or synthetic turf, up to $1,000. 
c. Building Code Title 24 
The City’s Building Code is in compliance with Title 24 of the California Building Code and Santa Barbara County Primary Building Code. The California Energy Commission has established and adopted energy improvement specifications for single-family and multiple-family structures under four stories. These specifications require active and passive energy features for all residential developments. 
d. Green Development 
The City’s Building Code is in compliance with California Green Building Standards Code of 2019 and the Santa Barbara County Primary Building Code. The provisions outlined in the Green Building Code provide two levels of incentives available to developers that exceed the require-ments outlined in the State of California CALGreen Building Code. These provisions encourage energy conservation in context of flexibility and creativity in residential building designs. Because they tend to reduce the cost of monthly utility bills, they also contribute to housing affordability. 
 
F. Evaluation of Accomplishments of 5th Cycle Housing Element 
As part of the periodic review of the housing element, each local government is required to evaluate its progress toward achieving the goals contained in the previous housing element. This evaluation should include a discussion of the following: 1) the effectiveness of the housing element in the attainment of the state housing goal; 2) an analysis of the significant differences between what was projected and what was achieved; and 3) a description of how the goals, objectives, policies, and programs of the updated element incorporate what has been learned from the results of the previous element. 
The ability of the City of Buellton to affect local housing needs is limited by the resources available for this purpose. These resources include land, enabling legislation, political leverage or housing expertise, and funding. Local governments, in particular, are constrained by the availability of funding for housing-related activities.

 Cumulative Impacts of Addressing Special Needs Housing 
 
Goal: Maintain Adequate Housing Sites 
 
Program 1: Maintain Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) Sites 
 Keep the existing AHOZ sites in the AHOZ inventory but re-evaluate and re-allocate sites in 2015. Sites shall continue to have a minimum density of 25 units per acre to ensure affordability.  
If any site is developed with a non-residential project or any development that does not meet the requirements of the AHOZ, a comparable acreage shall be rezoned to the AHOZ designation to offset the loss.  
For sites in excess of 2 acres, the City will encourage and give favorable consideration to land divisions and specific plans resulting in parcel sizes that facilitate the development of affordable housing projects in light of state and federal funding programs that favor projects of between 50 and 150 units. The City will facilitate the development of these sites for low income housing.  
 The sites have been maintained with a minimum 25 units/acre density and 20% affordability for residential development. However, since the underlying zoning is General Commercial (CR), two sites have been entitled and developed as such. Additional sites have not been re-allocated since the City still maintains enough adequate sites to meet the 5th cycle RHNA. The sites that have been developed with residential have used the methods in the described programs. 
- Site I - Underutilized 
- Site II - Undeveloped 
- Site III - Undeveloped 
- Site IV – Undeveloped; application submitted for 100% affordable 49 multi-family unit development under SB 330/35: “Polo Village” 
Site V - Developed as Residential Multifamily: Juliette Walk 
- Site VII - Underutilized 
- Site IX - Portion entitled with CR: The Waypoint. Portion undeveloped, with application submitted for 100% affordable 89 multi-family unit development under SB 330: “Buellton Garden” 
- Site X developed with Avenue Heights Apartments – counted toward this planning period’s RHNA (5 VL, 4 Low & 53 mod) 
- Site XI - Developed as CR: Hampton Inn 
 Two AHOZ sites have been developed with affordable housing, which helps to address special needs populations housing needs who tend to be in need of affordable housing. Two AHOZ sites have applications submitted for 100% affordable to households who are low-income and below (Polo Village and Buellton Garden), and plan to have services for elderly veterans and persons who are at-risk or previously homeless. On-site services for special needs populations are planned at these developments. 
 
Program 2: Promote Secondary Units and Underdeveloped Multi-Family Infill 
 Maintain the current secondary unit regulations that allow secondary units on smaller lot sizes and exempts them from the inclusionary housing requirements.  
 Zoning Ordinance Amendment adopted in 2020. ADUs exempt from inclusionary housing requirements. Six ADUs have received 
 ADUs typically provide a more affordable housing choice for elderly, those with disabilities, farmworkers, and small families with female heads of households. More ADUs have been built

 Action 
 Current Status of Progress 
 Cumulative Impacts of Addressing Special Needs Housing 
 
Continue to provide a 2:1 bonus density for infill multi-family units up to a maximum increase of 50% above the base density.  
Continue to allow a reduction in development standards for infill multi-family units by discretionary review as an additional density bonus incentive under the current affordable housing regulations.

While the City maintains the 2:1 density bonus, multi-family development with affordable units have shown greater interest California Density Bonus Law allowances. 
 in the 2015-2023 cycle than in the previous, under the City’s ADU ordinance. 
 
Program 3: RHNA Allocation 
 Update the Affordable Housing Ordinance (AHO) to reflect the 2015-2023 RHNA allocation.  
 Zoning ordinance to be amended in for the 6th cycle 2023-2031 RHNA.

Goal: Provide Continuing Affordable Housing Supply 
 
Program 4: Inclusionary Housing and Density Bonus  
 Continue to implement the Inclusionary Housing ordinance requiring a 15% inclusionary requirement for all residential projects, except for AHOZ projects which have a 20% inclusionary requirement. The distribution of inclusionary units among the target income groups shall be based on the apportionment of RHNA goals.  
Continue to implement the density bonus ordinance requirements that are consistent with state law. The City shall review and update its regulations as needed to reflect any changes to state law.  
 Program has been maintained and implemented for inclusionary requirements and distribution of affordable units among income levels based on Net RHNA Goals.  
Zoning Ordinance to be amended in the upcoming planning cycle to reflect updated California Density Bonus Law. 
 By maintaining the inclusionary program, affordable units have been built and the City’s in-lieu fee fund has grown. In-Lieu Funds have been granted towards a senior apartment community, “Village Senior Apartments,” with on-site services for veterans and those who were previously homeless. 
 
Program 5: Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) 
 Maintain the AHOZ designated properties and their minimum 20% inclusionary housing requirement. 
 AHOZ has maintained its 20% minimum inclusionary housing requirement.  
 Two AHOZ sites have been developed with 20% affordable housing, and two AHOZ sites have applications submitted for 100% affordable to households who are low-income and below, and plan to have services for elderly veterans and persons who are at-risk or previously homeless. On-site services for special needs populations are planned at these developments.

Program 6: Secondary Dwellings and Infill Inducements 
 Support secondary dwelling development as a source of affordable housing and maintain their exemption from inclusionary requirements in exchange for agreements by property owners to affirmatively market the units to income qualifying tenants under Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program.  
Seek grant funds and establish a rehabilitation/construction loan program to help reduce development costs and induce production of secondary units. In exchange for financing, owner/developers of secondary units shall be obligated to affordability covenants for a minimum of 10 years.  
Amend the AHO to require Housing Trust Fund expenditures to be used to assist households of extremely low, very low, low, and moderate income. Ensure that no less than 50% of the Fund shall be used to assist extremely low and very low-income housing.  
 Six ADUs have received building permits in the 2015-2023 planning period, and are exempt from inclusionary requirements as described through the Affordable Housing Ordinance.  
LEAP Grant funding has been received in part for the implementation of a Pre-Approved ADU Plans program, scheduled to be in place by 2023. 
 As previously noted, ADUs typically provide a more affordable housing choice for elderly, those with disabilities, farmworkers, and small families with female heads of house-holds. More ADUs have been built in the 2015-2023 cycle than in the previous, under the City’s ADU ordinance. 
 
Program 7: Targeted Assistance 
 Actively pursue grant and loan funding to finance the various housing initiatives listed in the Housing Element; (i) work cooperatively with for-profit and non-profit housing sponsors to leverage resources (e.g., state and federal tax credits); (i) continue participation in the HOME Consortium and CDBG Urban County and actively pursue CDBG funding for projects; (iii) assist with site identification and support applications for funding for farmworker housing such as the Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant Program; and (iv) evaluate other local funding options and implement if deemed feasible. In specific regard to other local funding sources, the City shall expressly evaluate the following: (i) adoption of a non-residential linkage development fee; (ii) imposition of a real estate transfer tax; 
 City participates in the HOME Consortium, CDBG and CoC. The City maintains the Housing In-Lieu Fee Fund, and expends funds for affordable residential development in accordance with the City’s Affordable Housing Ordinance.  
The City continues to work cooperatively with developers to leverage funding resources. No applications for farmworker housing have been submitted in the 2015-2023 planning period. The City has not evaluated a non-residential linkage development fee, imposition of a real estate transfer fee, or dedication of transient occupancy taxes for other local housing funding sources. 
 As a part of the County HOME Consortium, the City has supported the Village Senior Apartments project in receiving HOME funds. The development is a senior apartment community, with on-site services for veterans. 
The City continues to work with developers of affordable housing with on-site services to special needs populations to leverage Tax Credit funds, HOME, the City’s Housing Trust Fund (In-Lieu Fund) and other resources such as Housing Authority vouchers.

In this regard, the City’s contribution can take one of a number of forms: (i) assisting in the review and preparation of concept drawings; (ii) analyzing development proforma and identifying gap financing; (iii) fast tracking the environmental review and entitlement permit process; (iv) utilizing the City’s police powers to provide necessary land use and zoning; (v) supporting applications submitted to funding agencies; and (vi) providing direct financial or development assistance. Recognizing the collaborative nature of affordable housing development, the City shall undertake the following: (i) continue participation in the County HOME Consortium and CDBG Urban County and similar collaborative efforts to affirmatively further emergency shelter, transitional housing, single room occupancy units, shared living arrangements, supportive services and congregate housing needs outlined in the Consolidated Plan; (ii) conduct workshops and advise for-profit and non-profit sponsors of Key Development Sites selected for application of an AHOZ, including dissemination of information on City website; and (iii) avail itself and offer all reasonable assistance to facilitate the develop-ment of affordable housing consistent with the General Plan and Housing Element, with particular emphasis on the needs of extremely low and very low income households and associated special needs population segments (e.g., farmworkers, disabled)  
 before submitting a formal application. The City has required the submission of proformas for affordable housing projects and has helped identify funding sources to help cover financing gaps. 
Projects on AHOZ sites receive streamlined environmental review. The City has rezoned for adequate site capacity for affordable housing, and has updated the City's Zoning Ordinance to allow various types of special needs housing. The City has supported applications submitted to funding agencies for HOME funding. The City granted in-lieu funds to an affordable multi-family develop-ment in 2021. The City continues to participate in the HOME Consortium, CDBG, CoC, and a Regional Housing and Homeless-ness Collaborative. Information on AHOZ sites is up on the City's website and brochures are available in the Planning Department.

 Continue the City’s financial support of the mobilehome repair program; evaluate the expansion of emergency repair assistance to encompass adaptive retrofit needs of disabled persons and inclusion of energy conservation features; conduct outreach to owners of sub-standard rental property to identify interest/willingness to engage in cooperative rehabilita-tion; establish a budget and seek grand funds to underwrite these endeavors; prioritize funds according to the severity of need and link affordable housing covenants to the amount of funds required.  
 City has appropriated funds for continuation of the Emergency Mobile Home Repair Program, from the Affordable Housing In-Lieu Fund. This program is administered by the Buellton Senior Center, as the mobilehome parks in the City are senior age-restricted. 
Continued outreach needs to be conducted to the mobilehome parks to make the program known to residents. The program needs to be evaluated further for adaptive retrofit and inclusion of energy conservation features. 
 The City has continued its financial support of the mobilehome repair program, which supports elderly residents in the senior age-restricted mobilehome parks.  
 
Program 13: Code Enforcement 
 There are an underdetermined number of motel rooms (concentrated in the area of Avenue of Flags) that may be in violation of zoning regulations by virtue of their long-term residential use. To protect tenants without compromising land use policies or vested property owner rights, the City shall undertake the following action. 
Transient Occupancy. The City shall amend its Municipal Code to: (i) clarify the definition of hotel and motel uses with respect to duration of occupancy; (ii) allow for a reasonable number of long-term visitor stays; (iii) provide for a reasonable amortization of existing non-conforming use; and (iv) make allowances for relocation payments in the event of tenant displacement. As part of the Municipal Code amendment, the City shall: (i) undertake analysis of candidate properties; (ii) ascertain the breadth and magnitude of potential nonconforming conditions; and (iii) evaluate the feasibility of an amnesty program whereby limited residential use may be continued in exchange for affordable housing covenants. 
 Municipal Code has been partially amended to this end regarding duration of occupancy, relocation assistance and replacement provisions; however, new stricter state legislation has been passed for relocation and replacement housing provisions. No amortization provisions have been codified, however, non-conforming residential uses in the hotels continue to be allowed. Two surveys of motels being used as long-term single room occupancies (SROs) have been taken, in 2017 and 2020. Program needs to be modified. 
 Residents in the SROs include families and persons at-risk of homelessness, and persons with disabilities. SROs continue to be allowed as non-conforming uses. Relocation assistance and replacement housing provisions have been implemented and undertaken for projects in which compliance with these provisions have been required per the Municipal Code.

Appendix B – Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) Analysis 
1. Introduction 


According to AB 686, housing elements due on or after January 1, 2021, must include an Assessment of Fair Housing consistent with the core elements of the analysis required by the federal Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Final Rule of 2015. This section will address the fair housing requirements for housing elements in accordance with state law. 
According to Government Code §8899.50(a), affirmatively furthering fair housing means: 
... taking meaningful actions that, taken together, address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws. 
The HCD has issued specific requirements and instructions for incorporating the fair housing requirements into the housing element as follows:  
1.  Assessment of Fair Housing: This includes a summary of fair housing issues, an analysis of available data to identify patterns of segregation or other barriers to fair housing, and prioritization of contributing factors to fair housing issues. 
2.  Housing Element Sites Inventory: This includes the identification of sites for future housing to accommodate all income levels of the City’s share of the RHNA that also serves the purpose of furthering more integrated and balanced living patterns. 
3.  Responsive Housing Programs: This includes program(s) that affirmatively further fair housing, promote housing opportunities throughout the community for protected classes, and address contributing factors identified in the Assessment of Fair Housing. 
This Appendix B complies with the first requirement above, which is also summarized in Section C (Housing Needs Assessment). The second requirement, the Sites Inventory, is covered in Section E (Housing Opportunity and Resources), and additional information on inventory of units at-risk is provided in Section C. Finally, the specific responsive housing programs addressing the fair housing issues identified in this Appendix and summarized in Section C, are outlined in Section B (Housing Plan).  
The City of Buellton has been affirmatively working on providing opportunities for additional affordable housing development in the city. Zone sites have been identified to accommodate housing needs towards the RHNA allocation goals and the City's Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) sites, and the recent streamlining policies on ADUs have allowed for greater housing affordable development in the city, such that, as stated in Section E, the City can accommodate its RHNA goal in all income categories with a combined surplus of 1,121 dwelling units. In addition, there are currently 15 pending approval pipeline projects (see Table H-40 in Section E.2.b above), which will provide approximately 230 affordable units for very low-, low, and moderate-income levels. The majority of these pipeline projects are multi-family, some are single-family units, and the rest are ADUs. These projects, in addition to the City’s policies that encourage affordable housing development, are not only meeting the City’s 
RHNA goals, but are also contributing to furthering fair housing in the city by providing a range of housing opportunities for all incomes.  
2. Assessment of Fair Housing 


The analysis below also takes into account the unique aspects of the City of Buellton. First, the City of Buellton is geographically small (about 1.58 square miles). In addition, when using data from ACS, for instance, the city boundary line fits within one Census Tract and overlaps three Census Block Groups. Readers should note that these tracts also include small unincorporated portions surrounding Buellton City, which is mostly open-space land. Second, Solvang is a city 3 miles southeast of Buellton with a comparable population of 6,126 in 2020. Aspects of Solvang help us understand the composition in the analysis for Buellton. The analysis will include data from the surrounding regions of Buellton for richer analysis. Third, and not the least, about half of the City of Buellton is residentially zoned, and the majority of the households are homeowners (approximately 70%), and about 74% of the homes are single-family homes. The following conforms to the requirements outlined in technical guidance provided by HCD. 
State law requires the AFFH analysis address patterns of segregation, disproportionate need, housing conditions, fair housing issues, and other trends in a community that impact fair housing. This section expands on the analysis performed on the City. Please note that the data of Census tracts and block groups expands into the unincorporated regions surrounding Buellton, which is mostly open space. In addition, statistical data have a high margin of error. Thus, the analysis herein should not be considered definitive when the observed patterns and trends for fair housing in Buellton are described.  
a. Patterns of Integration and Segregation 


As outlined above, the City of Buellton is approximately 1.6 square miles in size. The data shown below shows a pattern of general integration which means a condition in which there are no high concentrations of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or having a disability or a particular type of disability when compared to a broader geographic area. On the other hand, segregation means a condition in which a high concentration exists of persons of the protected classes previously mentioned.  
Buellton is in the southern center part of Santa Barbara County and as shown in Figure H-6 below, is generally occupied by Latinx-White cities (e.g., Santa Barbara, Lompoc, Carpinteria, Solvang). “Mostly White” areas are located in the north and east of Santa Barbara City, “Mostly Latinx” areas are located on the northwest side of the county near Santa Maria, and three or four group mix race/ethnic areas are located on the west and center south of the county as well as near Goleta and Isla Vista, located near the coast on the south of the county.

Similarly described under the population characteristics in Section C.1 of this Element, the City of Buellton continues to be a predominantly white city, although data shows that parts of Buellton are moving in the direction of becoming more diverse. Figure H-7 on the next page shows the racial demographics by Block Group in 2010 and 2018. The top of Figure H-7 represents the racial demographics by block group in 2010 represented by the percent of total non-white population. The specific figures are as follows: top dark block group is at 24%, the bottom block group at 12%, and the east block group at 20%. For 2018, the bottom map of Figure H-7, the specific figures are as follows: top block group is at 50%, the bottom light orange block group at 28%, and the east block group at 44%. Comparing the two maps and figures shows that the Buellton area is increasing in its percentage of total non-white population, especially in the northern part of Buellton.

The observations seen in the maps under Figure H-7 are confirmed by the City’s National Demographic Corporation (NDC) By-District Elections map and data, which has the city divided into four districts, as seen in Figure H-8 below. This effort was done after “significant community outreach and engagement, including website information, online mapping tools, public participa-tion tools, newspaper advertising, public hearings, the Buellton Buzz, and social media posts.”2

As seen in Table H-46 above, the population by racial demographics shows that there are no concen-trations of African Americans, Asian, or Native Americans. District 3 shows a higher number of Latinos and, as an observed contributing factor, the City’s local knowledge has confirmed that Hispanic/Latinx appear to be in higher concentrations along the Highway 101 and District 3 (according to Figure H-8) is drawn east of Highway 101.

b. Income and Poverty 


As described in Section D of the Housing Element, the 2015-2019 ACS reports that the median household income is $93,099 in Buellton, approximately 24% higher than the state. In addition, the ACS data showed that household income levels are generally distributed among the various income levels; however, about half of all households earn above $93,000. Figure H-9 below provides a map of household income in the City of Buellton and the Santa Barbara County. Compared to the county, the household income levels by RHNA category are 33.3% very low (23.3% countywide), 22.4% low (15.8% countywide), 18.2% moderate (17.7% countywide), and about 26.1% above moderate income (43.2% countywide).

According to HUD, the block groups that represent Buellton have different percentages of their population that are low-moderate income. As seen in Figure H-10 on the previous page, the block group on the southern part of Buellton has the greatest percentage where 58% of its population is low to moderate income, the block group to the east is calculated at 32%, and the block group to the northwest is at 22%.  
Taking a closer look, by using the City of Buellton’s district data (refer to Figure H-8 for the City’s district map), Table H-47 below shows that similar to the block group with the highest low-moderate income on the map in the previous page, District 1, located on the southwest side of Buellton, has 48% of its household population earning $75,000 or less. District 4, which covers the west part of Buellton, has the second highest population where 38% of its household population earn $75,000 or less, annually.

Families with income below the poverty level are at great risk of becoming homeless and typically require special programs to assist them in meeting their rent and mortgage obligations to prevent homelessness. The 2015-2019 ACS data calculated that 132 persons (2.7% of the Buellton population) are living below the poverty level. Of these, 102 are male and 30 are female. These households need assistance with housing subsidies and other supportive services.  
c. Racially or Ethnically Concentrated Areas of Poverty and Affluence 


Concentrations of poverty and affluence can be a fair housing concern if they are associated with single race or ethnic groups. A racially or ethnically concentrated area of poverty (R/ECAPs) is an area in which 50% or more of the population identifies as non-White and 40% or more of residents live in poverty (or is three times the average tract poverty rate for the metro/micro area, whichever threshold is lower). There are no R/ECAPs in Buellton, although several exist in other cities in the county near the coast (e.g., Santa Maria, Lompoc, Santa Barbara).  
While racially concentrated areas of poverty and segregation (R/ECAPs) have long been the focus of fair housing policies, racially concentrated areas of affluence (RCAAs) must also be analyzed to ensure housing is integrated, a key to fair housing choice. According to HUD, a racially concentrated area of affluence (RCAA) is defined as a census tract in which 80% or more of the population is White and has a median income greater than $125,000 annually. Though Buellton is predominantly White, there are no known concentrations of affluence in Buellton or the immediate vicinity. 
3. Outreach and Enforcement 


The City of Buellton is part of the Santa Barbara HOME Consortium and Urban County Partnership, referred to throughout the rest of the document as “Consortium,” which receives federal housing and community development funds from HUD. This Consortium includes all jurisdictions of Santa Barbara County, except the City of Santa Barbara and the City of Guadalupe. As part of this Consortium, an Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice, or AI, is a planning process performed for local jurisdictions and public housing agencies to take meaningful actions to overcome historic patterns of segregation, promote fair housing choice, and foster inclusive communities that are free from discrimination. This analysis is performed every 5 years which includes an outreach survey of residents living in the jurisdiction members. A copy of the 2020 AI is provided at: https://santabarbaraca.gov/sites/default/files/2022-06/Santa%20Barbara%20Analysis%20of%20Impediments%20to%20Fair%20Housing_final%282020%29.pdf, and the following paragraphs provide summaries of their fair housing enforcement reporting from the analysis, especially in relation to Buellton. 
The federal Fair Housing Act, passed in 1968 and amended in 1988, prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, gender/sex, familial status, and disability. The Fair Housing Act—Amended (FHAA) covers most types of housing including rental housing, home sales, mortgage and home improvement lending, and land use and zoning. HUD has the primary authority for enforcing the FHAA. HUD investigates the complaints it receives and determines if there is a “reasonable cause” to believe that discrimination occurred. If reasonable cause is established, HUD brings the complaint before an Administrative Law Judge. Parties to the action can elect to have the trial held in a federal court (in which case the Department of Justice brings the claim on behalf of the plaintiff).  
To summarize, federal fair housing laws prohibit discrimination based on: race, color, religion, national origin, sex/gender, handicap/disability, and familial status. Specific federal legislation and court rulings include: 
• The Civil Rights Act of 1866- covers only race and was the first legislation of its kind 

• The Federal Fair Housing Act 1968- covers refusal to rent, sell, or finance  

• The Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988- added the protected classes of handicap and familial status  

• The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)- covers public accommodations in both businesses and in multi-family housing developments  

• Shelly v. Kramer 1948- made it unconstitutional to use deed restrictions to exclude individuals from housing  

• Jones v. Mayer 1968- made restrictive covenants illegal and unenforceable  


 
In addition, the State of California has a substantially equivalent law prohibiting discrimination in housing. The Fair Employment & Housing Act (FEHA) is the primary state law prohibiting discrimination in the sale, rental, lease negotiation, or financing of housing based on a person’s race, religion, national origin, color, sex, marital status, ancestry, family status, disability, sexual orientation, and source of income. The state’s law exceeds the protections in the federal Fair Housing Act by including protected classes of marital status, sexual orientation, and source of income. In addition, the law defines physical and mental disability as conditions that limit a major life activity; this definition of disability is broader than the federal definition, which requires a “substantial limitation.” The FEHA also incorporates the protections of the Unruh Act which 
includes medical condition as a protected category. Additional fair housing laws applicable to California jurisdictions include:  
• Unruh Civil Rights Act – Protects residents from discrimination by all business establishments in California, including housing and accommodations.  

• Ralph Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code Section 51.7) – forbids acts of violence or threats of violence on the basis of race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, political affiliation, or position in a labor dispute.  

• Bane Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code §52.1) – protects residents from interference by force or threat of force with an individual’s constitutional or statutory rights, including a right to equal access to housing.  

• California Civil Code §1940.3 – prohibits landlords from questioning potential residents about their immigration or citizenship status.  

• Government Code §11135, §65008, and §§65580-65589.8 – prohibit discrimination in programs funded by the state and in any land use decisions. §§65580-65589.8 was recently changed for the provision of special needs housing through: • Housing for persons with disabilities (SB 520); 

• Housing for homeless persons, including emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive housing (SB 2); 

• Housing for extremely low-income households, including single-room occupancy units (AB 2634); and, 

• Housing for persons with developmental disabilities (SB 812). 





The City of Buellton has committed to complying with applicable federal and state fair housing laws to ensure that housing is available to all persons without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, disability, familial status, or sex as outlined in the County’s 2020 AI as described earlier. In addition, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) prohibits discrimination in any aspect of housing on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, disability, familial status, or sex. Furthermore, the City of Buellton has adopted housing and reasonable accommodation regulations and procedures in 2013. Municipal Code Chapter 15.66 establishes these procedures in conformance with fair housing law.  
When residents who are facing housing discrimination or fair housing issue in Buellton, they are referred by the City staff to fair housing agencies to learn more about the federal and state fair housing laws pertinent to their situation. City staff also show how they can submit a complaint to HUD or the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) at www.fairhousingsantabarbara.com. This resource guide was put together by the Legal Aid Foundation of Santa Barbara County and Santa Barbara County to be utilized by residents in the region. The City also educates and informs residents and mobilehome owners about the City’s code enforcement services which has a formal complaint filing system and engages in rectifying substandard housing conditions. As stated in the fair housing program, the City will be adding additional information on the City’s Code Enforcement program and the Emergency Mobile Home Repair Program on their website so that it will be easily accessible for renters and owners. The City will also be working with Buellton Senior Center and other community stakeholders to inform residents about fair housing laws and services available on an annual basis.  
The county collected fair housing complaint data from HUD’s Office of Fair Housing Enforcement. According to the AI published in 2020, only one fair housing disability complaint was received in 
the City of Buellton between the years of 2015 and 2019. For further information on Buellton’s population with disability and the regional and local agencies that provide assistance and resources to this population, please refer to “Persons with Disabilities” under Section 4, Special Housing Needs, of part C (Housing Needs Assessment) of the Housing Element. This section provides more information on how the City accommodates the needs of disabled persons, programs in place, as well as how the City complies with existing fair housing laws. 
4. Disability 


Persons with disabilities have special housing needs because of their fixed income, the lack of accessible and affordable housing, and the higher health costs associated with their disability. As stated, Section C, Housing Needs Assessment provides information on population with a disability at the local level. Regionally, according to the 2015-2019 ACS, 10% of Santa Barbara County residents experience a disability. Buellton has the second to largest population of residents with a disability, making up 11% of the population compared to jurisdictions nearby: Solvang (9%), Lompoc (13.4%), and Santa Barbara city (10.1%). The most common disabilities in the County are ambulatory difficulties (4.6% with a disability) and independent living difficulties (4.8% with a disability).  
As shown in Figure H-11 below, most tracts in Santa Barbara County have disabled population of up to 20%. One tract has a larger population of persons with disabilities exceeding 20% which is in or near the city of Lompoc. Tracts where less than 10% of the population is disabled are generally more concentrated in the coastal areas on the west and south side of the county. 
In summary, Buellton has the second largest population of persons with disabilities compared to the County and some nearby jurisdictions. This is likely in part due to its aging population as discussed Section C, Housings Needs Assessment.

5. Familial Status 


Familial Status refers to the presence of children under the age of 18, whether the child is biologically related to the head of household, and the marital status of the head of households. Families with children may face housing discrimination by landlords who fear that children will 
cause property damage. Some landlords may have cultural biases against children of the opposite sex sharing a bedroom. Differential treatments such as limiting the number of children in a complex or confining children to a specific location are also fair housing concerns. Single parent households are also protected by fair housing law.  
According to the 2015-2019 ACS, shown in Table H-48 below, 35.5% of Buellton households are families with children related to the householder. The City’s share of households with children is higher than the County (33.0%) and some of the nearby cities including Solvang (27.1%), Goleta (31.0%), and Santa Barbara City (22.6%). Lompoc has the highest share of family households at 43.1%. Countywide, single-parent households make up 10.7% of all households, including 7.4% single-parent female-headed households. In Buellton, 7.1% of single-parent households are male-headed households and 5.6% are female-headed households.

6. Access to Opportunities  


HUD developed an index for assessing fair housing by informing communities about disparities in access to opportunity. Index scores are based on the following opportunity indicators (values range from 0 to 100):  
• Low Poverty Index: The higher the score, the less exposure to poverty in the neighborhood. 

• School Proficiency Index: The higher the score, the higher the school system quality is in a neighborhood.  

• Labor Market Engagement Index: The higher the score, the higher the labor force participation and human capital in a neighborhood. 

• Transit Trips Index: The higher the trips transit index, the more likely residents in that neighborhood utilize public transit.  

• Low Transportation Cost Index: The higher the index, the lower the cost of transportation and in that neighborhood. 

• Jobs Proximity Index: The higher the index value, the better access to employment opportunities for residents in a neighborhood.  

• Environmental Health Index: The higher the value, the better environmental quality of a neighborhood. 


To assist in this analysis, the HCD and the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (TCAC) convened in the California Fair Housing Task Force (Task Force) to “provide research, evidence-based policy recommendations, and other strategic recommendations to HCD and other related 
state agencies/departments to further the fair housing goals.” The Task Force has created Opportunity Maps to identify resources levels across the state. These opportunity maps are made from composite scores of three different domains made up of a set of indicators. Based on these domain scores, tracts are categorized as Highest Resource, High Resource, Moderate Resource, Moderate Resource (Rapidly Changing), Low Resource, or areas of High Segregation and Poverty. The table below shows the full list of indicators:

Poverty and Racial/Segregation 
 Poverty: tracts with at least 30% of population under federal poverty line 
Racial Segregation: Tracts with location quotient higher than 1.25 for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, or all people of color in comparison to the County 
 

 
Please note that in the case when data is available at the Census Tract level, the scores represent data beyond the City limits and is inclusive of the unincorporated rural land north of the City.  
HUD Opportunity Indicator scores for Santa Barbara County are shown in Table H-49 below. The White Population received the highest scores in low-poverty, school proficiency, and labor market. The White population below the federal poverty line did not score high on any of the indicators. The Hispanic population received the highest score in low transportation cost and transit, including the Hispanic population below the federal poverty line. Among the population below the federal poverty line, Asian or Pacific Islander had the highest score in poverty, school proficiency, low transportation cost, and transit. The Native American population below the poverty line had a high score for labor market and jobs proximity.

As seen in Figure H-12 below, Santa Barbara County contains a mix of highest, high, moderate, and low resource tracts. High resource tracts are most concentrated on the middle and south side of the County, which includes cities like Buellton, Santa Barbara, and Solvang. The low resource tracts are concentrated on the northeast and southwest parts of the County.

b. Economic 


The Fair Housing Task Force calculates economic scores based on poverty, adult education, employment, job proximity, and median home values. At the regional level, according to the 2022 Task Force maps, Figure H-14 shows economic score for tracts in Santa Barbara County. Tracts with lower economic scores (orange) are spread out and located on the northwest, southwest, and east of the County. Some of these tracts are in rural areas. The tracts showing the highest economic opportunity score are on the southeast side, especially where Santa Barbara city is.  
At the local level, according to the 2021 Task Force maps presented in Figure H-15, two block groups that overlay Buellton on the east and south have an economic score of 0.20 and 0.11, respectively, showing that these block groups have a less positive economic outcome. The third block group that overlays the northwest part of Buellton has a score of 0.57, which explains there is a more positive economic outcome. Block groups near Solvang show slightly higher economic scores than Buellton.  
Explanations for the low economic scores could be due to having a low percentage of adults with a bachelor’s degree or above (see Education in Section C) and high value of owner-occupied units in the city.

c. Education  


Data on math and reading proficiency, high school graduation rates, and student poverty rates are taken into consideration by the Fair Housing Task to determine education scores. At the regional level, Figure H-16 below shows education scores for tracts in Santa Barbara. Tracts with lower positive education outcomes are spread out and are located on the northwest side, southwest, and east of Santa Barbara. The tracts that have higher scores of positive education outcomes are located in the middle of Santa Barbara and southeast side, especially around the Santa Barbara City. 
As shown in Figure H-17, all the block groups that cover the City received education scores in the third highest quartile (scores between 0.50 and 0.75), showing that these areas are classified as having more positive education outcomes. Please note that the regional map shows data from 2022 at the census tract level compared to the local map which is from the 2021 data at the census block group level. These two maps cannot be compared for the same year. One key difference at the census tract where Buellton resides in the 2022 regional map is that it is under the highest category, with a score of 0.788, meaning that Buellton resides in census tracts where it is determined to have more positive educational outcomes. Data at the census block group is available from TCAC and all three census block groups that overlay Buellton for 2022 have a score of 0.514, which means it would in the light green category in the map below, if the map was designed to the census block group level.

d. Environment 


Environmental health scores are determined by the Fair Housing Task Force based on CalEnviroScreen 3.0 pollution indicators and values. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) compiles these scores to help identify California communities disproportionally burdened by multiple sources of pollution. In addition to environmental factors (pollutant exposure, groundwater threats, toxic sites, and hazardous materials exposure) and sensitive receptors (seniors, children, persons with breathing difficulties, such as asthma, and low birth weight infants), CalEnviroScreen also takes into consideration socioeconomic factors. These factors include educational attainment, linguistic isolation, poverty, and unemployment. Figure H-18 shows that all block groups in Buellton have the second highest environmental scores between 0.50 and 0.75. This means that Buellton residents are not 
disproportionately affected by unhealthy levels of pollution compared to other areas of the state. The areas surrounding Buellton also have the high environmental quality. At the countywide level, Figure H-19 shows that low environmental scores are on tracts on the west side of the Santa Barbara County and in tracts in Goleta and Santa Barbara city.

OEHHA’s CalEnviroScreen 4.0 tool of California communities by census tract provides a breakdown of the census tract where Buellton resides which helps understand why Buellton is categorized in an area with positive environmental outcomes. However, please note that this CalEnviroScreen 4.0 score is only available at the census tract level, which not only includes the City of Buellton, but also a substantial amount of unincorporated rural land north of the City limits. Because this specific Census Tract is dominated by rural land, the scores presented in Table H-4 does not fully represent conditions within the City limits. That said, CalEnviroScreen 4.0 scores do not necessarily apply to the City of Buellton, and thus, the scores below should not be treated as the conditions representative to the City, since they are not. Table H-53 provides us with the results of each indicator range from 0 to 100. These numbers indicate the percentile ranking of 
census tract 608001901 relative to other census tracts in California. According to OEHHA, the calculation of the CanEnviroScreen score is based on the multiplication of the pollution burden and population characteristics. The population burden is the average of exposures and environmental effects, and the population characteristics are the average of sensitive populations and socioeconomic factors. A high score shows that a combination of pollution burden and population characteristics have great vulnerability than the lower scores. As we can see from the table below, the CalEnviroScreen score is 28 for the census tract where Buellton resides, which is a lower score and ranking compared to 8,000+ census tracts in California. Looking at the specific indicators helps us understand why Buellton is not in the top quartile score for more positive environmental outcomes. Indicators under exposures have very low scores; however, indicators under the environmental effects have high scores.

e. Transportation 


HUD’s Job Proximity Index helps us understand the accessibility of a given residential neighborhood to all job locations in a given area by using distance to employment centers, large employers weighing heavily than smaller employers. In other words, block groups with lower jobs proximity indices are located further from employment opportunities and have a higher need for transportation. Figure H-20 below shows that the eastern block group on Buellton has the most access to employment opportunities (index score = 93). The southern block group has score of 63, which is classified as the second highest score. The block group that covers part of northwest Buellton has a score of 51, which shows as the least area in Buellton to have access to employers by distance.

At the regional level, as seen in Figure H-21, above, we can see that the majority of the Santa Barbara County has a medium index. Higher indices of jobs proximity are in census groups located to the north, west, and southwest of the County. In addition, census block groups on the south east side of the County show higher job proximity index. These show a correlation to areas where there are employment opportunities in the Santa Barbara area.  
The next two figures (Figure H-22 and Figure H-23) below are All Transit Scores at for Santa Barbara County and Buellton. All Transit explores metrics that reveal the social economic impact of transit, specifically looking at connectivity, access to jobs, and frequency of service. According to the most recent data posted (2019), Santa Barbara County has an AllTransit Performance Score of 4.3 (out of 10), indicating a low combination of trips per week and number of jobs accessible by 
transit. For Buellton, the AllTransit Score is 1.2 (out of 10), which is much lower than the County. As we saw in Figure H-20, the two census block groups on the left side of the City have low job proximity index scores of 40-80, compared to 80+ on the east side of Buellton. Given that the City is 1.58 square miles, transportation and access to services and jobs within the City boundaries is relatively accessible. In addition, the development of mixed-use and affordable housing encourages fewer trips and accessibility to services, especially for members of protected class.

7. Disproportionate Housing Needs 


The AFFH Rule Guidebook defines disproportionate housing needs as a condition in which there are significant disparities in the proportion of members of a protected class experiencing a category of housing needs when compared to the proportion of a member of another relevant groups or the total population experiencing the category of housing need in the applicable geographic area. The following section is an assessment of the disproportionate housing needs, including displacement risk, on people with protected characteristics and households with low incomes. This analysis is important to understand how some groups of persons experience severe housing needs when compared to other populations at a local level and in a region. Disproportionate need is often reflected in overpayment rate or cost burden (i.e., housing costs greater than 30%), overcrowding (more than 1 person per room), and housing conditions or substandard housing (e.g., incomplete plumbing or kitchen facilities).  
Housing problems for Buellton was assessed by using HUD’s 2020 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data based on the 2015-2019 ACS. This data provides information on housing needs by income level for different types of households in Buellton. Housing problems considered by CHAS include:  
• Housing cost burden or overpayment, including utilities, exceeding 30% of gross income; 

• Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room)' 

• Lacks complete kitchen facilities; and,  

• Lacks complete plumbing facilities. 

a. Housing Cost Burden 


Section C, Housing Needs Assessment, provides information on the housing cost burden situation in Buellton. To summarize, according to HUD’s 2015-2019 CHAS data, there are a total of 605 households out of the 1,940 total households (or 31.8%) in the city who overpay or are housing cost burdened. Specifically, 320 homeowners (out of total 1,355) are cost burdened and 285 (out of 585) renters are housing cost burdened in the city. In addition, 145 renters are extremely cost burdened and 85 homeowners are extremely cost burdened. This shows that a higher proportion of renters are cost burdened.  
Because housing is the largest single expense item for most households, housing is considered affordable when a household spends 30% or less of its household income for shelter. However, for those who are cost-burdened, they are left with limited income available for other necessities such as food, medicine, and transportation.  
Table H-54 below is a breakdown of households by race or ethnicity and cost burden for Buellton and Santa Barbara County. Compared to Buellton’s 31.8% of households who are cost burdened, Santa Barbara County has 35.6% of its total households, which is more than the City’s. More owner-occupied households are cost-burdened Countywide (26.9%) compared to the City (18.6%). In addition, the table below shows estimates that Hispanics, Blacks, and another race (“Other”) are cost-burdened at the highest rate. While 18.6% of White owners experience housing cost burdens, HUD CHAS estimates that 50.9% of White renters experience housing cost burdens. To put in context, there are an estimated 1,415 White households and 355 White households are estimated to be experiencing housing cost burden. In addition, according to the 2015-2019 HUD CHAS data, there are 175 Hispanic households, so this means that about 87 Hispanic households are housing cost-burdened. There are an estimated 10 “Other” households and 15 Black households. While 
there are an estimated 25 Asians, a small population, the HUD CHAS data estimates there are zero (0) Pacific Islander households in the City.

The following four figures compare overpaying owners by Census Tract using the 2010-2014 and 2015-2019 ACS. The proportion of overpaying owners has remained the same. However, these figures, as similarly stated earlier, are shown at the Census Tract geographic level. As the figures show, the Census Tract where Buellton resides extends beyond the City boundaries. However, these figures show that the Census Tracts surrounding Buellton City have decreased. Countywide, Santa Barbara has seen an estimated increase of households experiencing housing cost burdens near Santa Barbara, the largest City, and along the West coast of the County. 
To summarize, with careful consideration that the figures below (Figure H-24, Figure H-25, Figure H-26, Figure H-27) are expressed at the Census Tract level, HUD CHAS data estimates that Buellton’s 31.1% of total households experience housing cost burdens and those affected are among renters, especially among Hispanic, Black, and White households.

b. Overcrowding 


The HCD defines overcrowding as housing units occupied by more than one person per room in a dwelling unit, excluding kitchen and bathrooms. A severely overcrowded unit is when there is more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding is generally less of an issue in the City of Buellton compared to the County. Table H-55 below shows a breakdown of percentages of units for both greater than 1 person and greater than 1.5 persons per room. According to HUD CHAS Data (2015-2019), 1.54% of Buellton households are overcrowded, which includes 1.1% of owner-occupied households and 2.56% of renter households. There are an estimated zero (0) units that are over-crowded; however, 10.2% of renter households are estimated to be severely overcrowded. To put in context, there are 1,940 households in Buellton, where 1,355 are owner-occupied, and 585 are renter-occupied. More specifically, according to the 2015-2019 ACS data, overcrowded households represented almost 1.2% of all owner-occupied households (16 households) and almost 13% of renter households (76 households) in Buellton. Combined, 4.7% of all 1,941 households (or 92 households in total) are overcrowded compared with 10.7% of all households in Santa Barbara County. 
Figure H-28 below the table shows overcrowded households by Census Tracts for the County of Santa Barbara. Countywide, overcrowding is most common on the Northwest side of Santa Barbara County near Santa Maria and in census tracts in or near Lompoc, Goleta, Santa Barbara, and Carpinteria. Overcrowding is far less prevalent in census tracts in and around Buellton. 
To summarize, overcrowding is generally not an issue in Buellton compared to the County. There are no known concentrations of overcrowded households in the City.

c. Substandard Housing Conditions 


The U.S. Census looks at two types of substandard housing problems: 1) households without a hot and cold piped water, a flush toilet, and a bathtub or shower; and, 2) households with kitchen facilities that lack a sink with piped water, a range or stove, or a refrigerator. These definitions look at what is included inside a housing unit, not outside. 
The 2015-2019 ACS data includes surveys about some of the factors that may result in substandard housing, such as lack of plumbing facilities and lack of complete kitchen facilities. Of the estimated 1,941 total housing units in the city, an estimated 43 units lack complete kitchen facilities. 
In addition, HUD’s 2015-2019 CHAS data tracks housing problems and severe housing problems. “Housing problems” is defined as a household having the following problems: incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more than 1 person per room, and cost burden greater than 30%. Severe housing problems is defined as having the following conditions: incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more than 1.5 persons per room, and cost burden greater than 50%. Table H-56 below shows proportions of units with housing problems and severe housing problems for the City of Buellton and Santa Barbara County. The CHAS data showed that 33.7% (655) out of the 1,940 have housing problems while 14.4% (280) have severe housing problems. These figures are significantly less than the County figures, where 45.9% (66,920) out of the County’s 145,855 total households have housing problems and 28.5% (41,680) have severe housing problems.  
Figure H-29 shows a regional map from the AFFH Data Viewer where see severe housing problems in the Santa Barbara County by city. The City of Buellton is categorized to have one of the least proportions of severe housing problems compared to the rest of the cities in the County. Cities who experience greater proportions housing units that have severe housing problems are located on the west, northwest, and southeast part of Santa Barbara County, with Isla Vista having the highest proportion of its housing units with severe housing problems.

Housing age can be used as a good indicator for substandard housing and rehabilitation needs. In general, residential structures over 30 years of age require minor repairs and modernization improvements, while units over 50 years of age are likely to require rehabilitation such as roofing, plumbing, and electrical system repairs.  
Table H-57 below shows housing unit age, broken down by three age-ranges, for the City of Buellton, Santa Barbara County, and the three Census Block Groups that overlay Buellton. As the table shows, approximately 19.6% (394) out of the 2,013 estimated housing units in Buellton are 50 years or older and approximately 38.4% (774) are approximately 30 to 40 years old. Additionally, 41.0% (845) are 30 years or less years old. These figures show that Buellton’s proportion of much older homes (50+ years) is less than the proportion of much older homes in Santa Barbara County, which is 45.4% (72,315) of the total 159,286 housing units estimated in the County. On the other hand, the proportion of housing units aged 30 to 40 years at the County level is 32.8% (52,245), which is slightly less than the City. Finally, the proportion of younger housing in City is significantly higher than the County's by approximately 20%.  
When looking at the estimates in the three Census Block Groups that overlay Buellton, but also extend beyond the City boundary, the estimates are calculated out of the total estimated housing units in each. Census Block Group 3 is estimated to have 967 units, and the table below shows that this Census Block Group has the highest proportion of younger housing units compared to the other two Census Block Groups at 41.0% (446 units). Census Block Group 4 has the highest proportion of units aged between 30 to 40 years at 60.3% (471 units), and Census Block Group 5 has the highest proportion of much older buildings (50+ years) where 54.5% (152 units) out of the 279 housing units have been built 50+ years ago. These figures make sense as older units appear to be located near the major highways. When calculating the summation of these three census block groups, the total adds up to 2,027 units, which is slightly greater than the estimated total units for the City.  
The analysis written above in relation to the table below suggests that the majority of the City’s housing stock is younger in age and likely do not require major rehabilitation soon.

The estimates noted in this analysis have a large margin of error. For instance, the ACS 2015-2019 estimates that 43 units lack a complete kitchen, but the margin of error for this figure is “±65,” which could mean that the estimate is anywhere between 22 and 108 units that lack a complete kitchen. Since these data do not provide accurate information, the City has additional data and local information on the city’s housing conditions: 
1. The City has researched the cases handled by the City of Buellton Code Enforcement for planning code violations, building code violations, and condition of units. They estimated that 0.5 to 1% of their total housing units are in substandard conditions. This does not necessarily mean that these conditions are considered dilapidated and not suitable for rehabilitation.  

2. The City has conducted its own independent field survey in July 2014 to determine housing units needing repair. This survey was published in Buellton’s 5th Housing Element, and found that 14 units have “deferred maintenance” condition and 2 units are in “moderate disrepair” condition. These 16 units represent close to 1% of the 1,856 total units counted in 2014.  

3. The City has two mobilehome parks which comprise of approximately 419 units. Based on information from on-site resident managers, it is estimated that 30 to 50 mobilehomes are in need of major repair. 

4. A survey conducted in 2020 on people living in motels (or SROs) along the Avenue of Flags gathered that 8 out of the 42 households surveyed lacked a complete kitchen. More information on this survey is available below. 

d. Displacement Risk 


UC Berkley’s Urban Displacement project defines residential displacement as “the process by which a household is force to move from its residence –or is prevented from moving into a neighborhood that was previously accessible to them because of conditions beyond their control.” As part of this project, the research has identified populations vulnerable to displacement (named “sensitive communities”) in the event of increased redevelopment and drastic shifts in housing cost. They defined vulnerability based on the share of low-income residents per tract and other criteria, including share of renters above 40%, share of people of color more than 50%, share of low-income households severely rent burdened, and proximity to displacement pressures. Displacement pressures were defined based on median rent increases and rent gaps. 
As shown in Figure H-30 below, several tracts or communities are identified as sensitive communities vulnerable to displacement in Santa Barbara County. These communities are located along the coast on the west and southeast portion of the County.  
In addition, UC Berkley’s Urban Displacement project also created an Estimated Displacement Risk (EDR) model for California, which identifies varying levels of displacement risk for low-income renter households in all census tracts in the state from 2015 to 2019. The model uses machine learning to determine which variables are most strongly related to displacement at the household level and to predict tract-level displacement risk statewide while controlling for region. UDP defines displacement risk as a census tract with characteristics which, according to the model, are strongly correlated with more low-income population loss than gain. In other words, the model estimates that more low-income households are leaving these neighborhoods than moving in. 
Figure H-31 shows a conservative estimate of low-income loss and is used as a tool to help identify housing vulnerability. Somewhat similar to the previous figure, vulnerable tracks at risk of displacement are located on the northwest part of the County, in or around Lompoc City, as well as communities near Santa Barbara city on the southeast portion of the County. Buellton is on the tract that appears to have a very low-risk of displacement. This correlates with lower proportions of households that are overcrowded and housing cost-burdened in the City as described in previous sections.

Knowing the population of individuals experiencing homelessness is a good indicator for displacement risk in communities. This information helps us understand where individuals have been observed, what reasons have led them to experience homelessness, and any additional special needs, such as health care.  
For information on the homeless population in Buellton and the County, please refer to Section C.4, “Special Housing Needs,” of the Housing Needs Assessment in this Housing Element, under the header “People Experiencing Homelessness.” This section provides local available data on individuals experiencing homelessness as well as the programs and resources available for this vulnerable population. This section states that the last point-in-time count for Buellton/Solvang/Santa Ynez Valley was 2 persons in 2020, compared to 5 persons in 2019.  
The latest point-in-time count in 2022 does not include Buellton; however, the count finds 12 persons living in Montecito, Guadalupe, Orcutt, and the Santa Ynez Valley. Figure H-32 below shows a map provided by the County on the breakdown of homeless individuals. In total, the County found 1,962 homeless individuals in the County, where 70% were unsheltered and 30% were sheltered. The County also found that almost half (42%) of homeless individuals enumerate lived in the city of Santa Barbara, while 23% lived in Santa Maria, 14% lived in Lompoc, and 5% lived in Goleta. In addition to the point-in-time count, they also surveyed individuals experiencing homelessness. Out of the 309 surveyed, they found that 64% have been without a home for more than three years, 39% have a mental health disability, 31% report having substance abuse issues, and 29% reported having chronic health problems.  
The County’s count of homeless population has increased over the years, from 1,803 in 2019 to 1,962 in 2022. To address these issues, the County reports having increased the number of beds for permanent housing by 80% between 2017 and 2022. Other forms of housing provided by the County are emergency shelter, transitional housing, and rapid rehousing.

Displacement due to environmental hazards is quite possible in Buellton. Please refer to the City’s Safety Element which provides detailed information on possible natural hazards residents may experience and thus displaced. According to the Safety Element, Buellton is located on an alluvial terrace of the Santa Ynez River, which makes it susceptible to flooding. The last times the City had sustained flood damage was in February 1993 and February 1998 due to heavy rainstorms. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), the map for Buellton indicated that there is substantial flooding potential that could affect the downtown, central, and south portions of the City. Figure H-33 below shows areas in Buellton where there is a 1% and a 0.2% annual chance flood hazard. The City of Buellton has goals, policies, and programs in place to protect lives and property of the residents and visitors of Buellton from unnecessary risk due to flooding, as outlined in the Safety Element.

To summarize, while the County’s homeless population has increased in the last few years, based on the displacement risk model above along with the estimated data on housing-cost burden and over-crowding, along with a potential risk of being displaced due to flooding from heavy rainstorm, Buellton appears to have a lower risk of displacement.  
8. Survey of Residents Living in SROs 


Currently, Buellton’s SROs are legal nonconforming uses as they were formerly motels. The City currently has four legal non-conforming SROs in the city, and they all are located in the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan area, which is the City’s main commercial area. This area is currently under-going revitalization as a result of the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan. Very-low and low-income residents reside in these SROs and a recent survey of their housing profile and needs is summarized below. Actions and resources property owners who own SROs and residents living in SROs are addressed in Section B (Housing Plan). 
In August and September 2020, the Santa Ynez Valley People Helping People collaborated with the Central Coast Collaborative on Homelessness and the City of Buellton to conduct a survey of people living in motels along Avenue of Flags to gather demographic and socioeconomic data. This survey gathered information from 42 households, representing a total of 110 people, 88 of them adults and 22 of them children, living in four motels. The survey found the following findings:  
• 87% of surveyed residents are living in extreme poverty. 

• 14 families and 27 adult-only households have incomes of $25,000 or less, with the majority making from $11,000 to $18,000 a year. 

• 43% of the households is below 100 percent of the federal poverty limit, and 65% of the households have an income below 138% of the federal poverty limit. 

• 83% of the households have at least one working adult. 

• 8 families are living in a single room with no kitchen, which HUD considers both overcrowded and substandard housing. 

• 36 of the households, or 75%, are considered permanent or long-term residents, with 22 of them, or 46%, having lived there for more than 3 years.  

• 91% of the households make less than $25,000 a year. 


According to the 2015-2019 ACS data, the median-gross rent for Buellton is $1,760 a month, or $21,120 a year. To afford rent in Buellton, a household would require an annual income of at least $70,400. In other words, the majority of the households living in the motels would have to spend almost all of their income to improve their living conditions. However, as outlined in Section C of the Housing Element, three of the motel/SRO buildings will undergo a process with City assistance to relocate SRO occupants to new and improved housing units at their existing rent levels. The remaining motel/SRO building, Red Rose Court, will retain its SRO units. 
9. Placed-Based Strategies and Revitalization Efforts 


The City of Buellton is committed in supporting efforts that transform communities into integrated and balanced living patterns. The following describes placed-based strategies that are creating opportunity in areas of disinvestment by enhancing infrastructure, services, and meeting community needs for low-income residents.  
The Avenue of Flags Specific Plan was adopted by Buellton City Council in 2017 with the overall goal of stimulating revitalization of the City’s aging downtown area. The Specific Plan embodies place-based strategies to create a sense of identity, provide community gathering opportunities, incentivize real estate development including mixed-use commercial and residential projects, and implement enhancements to the public infrastructure. Revitalization of the downtown area would benefit the adjacent neighborhoods and the community as a whole.  
The main thoroughfare through downtown is the Avenue of Flags (“AOF”), the former route of Highway 101 before its re-alignment in the early 1960s. Currently there are two vehicle travel lanes in both directions, separated by very wide (75-80 feet) city-owned medians that contain grass and landscaping. A key component of the community revitalization effort is the transformation of the AOF roadway to a vibrant pedestrian friendly main street. Designating the intersection of AOF and 2nd Street as a Town Plaza area, providing for public and civic uses on the adjacent medians, will promote neighborhood identity and a welcoming presence to the downtown area. The Specific Plan envisions enhancements to the medians and adjacent street network, including construction of town plaza, amphitheater, public park, community amenities, and combination off-street parking area and multi-use event space. 
The following placed-based strategy efforts directly support community revitalization goals:  
Median 2 Makeover  
Transformation of this median from a grassy underutilized space to a new parking and multi-use area was completed in 2021, funded by the City’s Capital Improvement Program. The Art Deco 
inspired improvements provide off-street parking for 44 vehicles and 2 motorcycles, and feature bicycle racks, decorative pavers, accent lighting, ample landscaping, and related amenities. This is the first of several public improvement projects envisioned in the AOF Specific Plan area. 
Median 3 – Civic-themed Median in Planning Stages 
In early 2022, Cal Poly SLO landscape architecture students created conceptual designs for a Civic-themed median that included a town plaza, amphitheater, park, and community amenities. Design elements from several of the concept plans will be taken into consideration as the City moves forward with preparing final designs and public improvement plans to transform the current grassy Median 3 into a downtown park as envisioned in the Specific Plan. The City has budgeted funds for preparation of the final design and construction plans, and has allocated funds in the 5-Year Capital Improvement Program towards construction of the capital improvements.  
Community Garden (Bordering AOF Specific Plan area) 
The Buellton City Council in mid-2022 agreed that the City-owned lot on the southeast corner of Second Street and Central Avenue may be used for a community garden. With support from the City and others, the Buellton Community Garden (non-profit organization) was formed and is proceeding with plans to improve the property for the purpose of growing fruits, flowers, vegetables, herbs to benefit the group, the neighbors, and the wider community. Residents in the surrounding medium density neighborhood and in the adjacent AOF Specific Plan area of future higher density dwellings will benefit from not only the produce being grown, but also the open space and community engagement opportunities provided by the Garden.  
10. Summary of AFFH Analysis and Sites Inventory 


The next two tables, Table H-58 and Table H-59, show sites inventory in the three Census Block Groups that overly the City of Buellton. The first table shows the site inventory list by Census Block Group and the following table shows the total number of RHNA units with respect to AFFH variables. Note that the table does not include information for sensitive communities and for severe housing problems due to the lack of data at the Census Block Group level. Given the AFFH analysis above and the table on the next page, the following provides a summary of the AFFH analysis and how the sites inventory may or may not exacerbate AFFH conditions:  
a. Integration and Segregation 


The City of Buellton is predominantly White and does not have any concentrations of racial/ethnic minorities. There is only one block group in the City with racial/ethnic minority populations exceeding 20%. Although there appears to be a high concentration of the ethnicity Hispanic in Census Block Group 3 (45.5%), the 2015-2019 ACS estimates that 60.0% of those who identified themselves as Hispanic identify with the race White. Similarly, 30.7% of those identified as Hispanics in Census Block Group 5 also identify themselves with the race White.  
Furthermore, the City’s Residential Sites Inventory used to meet the 2023-2031 RHNA does not disproportionately concentrate lower or moderate-income units in these census block group. There are no moderate income units located in census block groups where racial/ethnic minorities make up 20-40% of the population and only 25% of lower income units are located within these tracts.  
Census block groups 4 and 5 in the City have an estimated population of persons with disabilities exceeding 20%. However, the City’s RHNA strategy does not concentrate lower or moderate-income units in these census block groups; 78% of lower income units are located in these census 
block groups compared to 35% of above moderate-income units. While these may appear to be in high numbers, lower income units come from five different sites such as the Village Senior Apartments and Buellton Garden Apartments. Sites are generally distributed throughout the City.  
Segregation on the basis of familial status is generally not an issue in Buellton. Though one census block group (5) has higher percentages of households with children who live in married couple households and female-headed households, a large proportion of the RHNA units are in these census block groups.  
There is one census block group (Census Block Group 4) that is considered an LMI area where more than 50% of households belong to low- or moderate-income groups. Of all the sites selected, 75.0% of lower income units and 22.9% of above moderate-income units are in the LMI area. This area has a higher percentage of seniors (27.7%) who tend to have low or nonexistent incomes. In addition, this area has 66.6% of its renters paying rent more than 30% of their monthly income. Though a higher proportion of lower income units is located in an LMI area compared to moderate and above moderate-income units, the City’s residential sites inventory is distributed throughout the City and does not concentrate lower income units in any one area. Furthermore, by locating potential lower income units in this area, the City has the opportunity to create the much needed affordable housing in the area.  
b. Racially or Ethnically Concentrated Areas of Poverty 


There are no R/ECAPs or TCAC-designated areas of high segregation and poverty in Buellton. 
c. Access to Opportunities 


All census block groups in the City are designated as high or moderate resource areas. Similarly, the tract where Buellton resides ranks in the 31st percentile or below for CalEnviroScreen 4.0 score indicating more desirable environmental conditions. There are no areas in the City with very poor environmental conditions. Therefore, the City’s residential sites inventory does not disproportionately concentrate units in low resource areas or expose units to significantly degraded environmental conditions.  
d. Disproportionate Housing Needs 


Buellton has two census block groups (Census Block Groups 3 and 4) where more than 45% of their renters pay more than 30% of their monthly income towards rent. In addition, two census block groups (Census Block Group 3 and 4) have owners paying more than 30% of their monthly income towards a mortgage. Census Block Group 4 has the highest proportion (64.7%) of renters overpaying but has the lowest proportion of overcrowded units. Most of RHNA units are in this census block group, providing opportunities for lower income households. Census Block Group 3 has the second highest overpaying renters (48.2%). Approximately 403 RHNA units, most from AHOZ II project are in this census block group, the majority being above moderate units. This census block group has the second highest LMI household. Lastly, Census Block Group 5 has no overpaying renters but 34.6% of owners pay more than 30% of their income towards their mortgage. This is the highest proportion compared to the other census block groups. In addition, this census block group has no overcrowded housing units. Approximately 313 RHNA units are in this census block group, the majority being above moderate. Overcrowding figures on all the three census Block Group has less than 8.2%, the statewide average. All the sites used to meet the RHNA located all of the three census block groups have a fair distribution throughout the City; therefore, 
the City does not disproportionately concentrate lower or moderate-income units in one area of the City.
