 SPEAKERS/DISCUSSION: 
 
Assistant Planner Cara Miralles presented a powerpoint outlining the history of the Avenue of Flags Specific Plan and introduced Ioanna Bruno, a CalPoly Landscape Architect student and intern 
 
Ioanna Bruno presented two conceptual plans for development of median No. 3 based on standards outlined in the Specific Plan. 
 
Assistant Planner Miralles asked the commission for comments on the conceptual designs.  
 
Chair Mercado thanked Ioanna Bruno for her presentation. 
 
Vice Chair Reese had comments about the use of warmer versus cooler colors in the design. She was “not sure” about the colonial art deco; calling it not very contemporary – If the design does go in that direction, she might want the warmer pavers with it but otherwise the warmer pavers seem off for an art deco/art moderne design. 
 
Commissioner Dan Contreras asked if the civic center was a mandatory requirement. Planning Director Keefer said it had been envisioned as part of the final design for median No. 3 and is part of the Specific Plan. 
 
Commissioner Contreras questioned the size of the amphitheater element and its proposed orientation vis-à-vis the sun. Public Works Director Hess mentioned the orientation takes advantage of the median’s natural grade. 
 
Vice Chair Reese questioned the orientation of the proposed art area and restrooms. Ioanna Bruo said the orientation was more for the residential view than the business view. 
 
Commissioner Marcilo Sarquilla liked both designs but wanted more of an impact statement piece visible from the north, perhaps archways.  He would also like a pond or pool feature and wanted to ensure the proposed decomposed granite was wheelchair safe. Ioanna Bruno stated the material was wheelchair appropriate. 
 
Chair Mercado does not like decomposed granite as a material. He stated it dissolves in winter. He was concerned the proposed bioswale could become a liability, particularly with small children playing in it. He stated concerns about the benches attracting a homeless population. He was concerned the proposed two stall public restroom would not have enough capacity. Ioanna Bruno said she had considered an additional restroom but that diminished available open space.  
 
Chair Mercado raised concerns the proposed trees and planting would require extensive maintenance and might become damaged during an event. Ioanna Bruno said the tree species were selected for site and climate appropriateness and the bioswale would reduce runoff and irrigating the current grass median runs off into the street. Assistant Planner Cara Mirales asked Public Works Director Hess about bioswale alternatives. Director Hess responded a French drain is in use for other medians. 
 
Commissioner Sarquilla stated his belief the proposed restrooms would be adequate, likening them to the restrooms at Solvang park. Again he stated he would like a shallow water feature for kids. Chair Mercado brought up the long term costs. 
 
 
PLANNING COMMISSIONER COMMENTS 
 
Commissioner Dan Contreras asked what kind of Art Deco design was being proposed. He wants a unified look rather than a mishmash. He sees the design as a potential focal point for the city. He is a fan of the bioswale but not too sure about the civic center as he would hate to lose the open space. He was concerned about the median’s impact on traffic. 
 
Commissioner Sarquilla liked the proposed designs and thanked Ioanna Bruno. 
 
Vice Chair Reese liked the use of the logo on both ends. She prefers the 2nd design. She likes the emphasis on alternate transportation. She was concerned the planters in place to protect bike lanes could impact events which currently utilize the whole avenue. She prefers pavers to decomposed granite. She likes the bioswale and use of natural topography. The proposed structures could provide opportunities for art programs and grants. She asked staff to consider rotating the structures so they would be perpendicular to the median for more frontage but noted this could affect the project’s sightlines. She also asked the staff consider incorporating shade structures. 
 
Chair Mercado thanked Ioanna Bruno and said she did an outstanding job. He reiterated his concerns with the bioswale and restated his preference for French drains. He also welcomed incoming Staff Assistant/Planning Technician Devon DeFazio to the role. 
 
 
 
PLANNING DIRECTOR REPORT 
  
Planning director Andrea Keefer thanked outgoing Staff Assistant/Planning Technician Clare Barcelona and wished her well in her retirement.
