Buellton Garden Apartments
Planning Projects
The proposed Buellton Garden Apartments Project consists of the construction of a new 89-unit
multi-family residential development on a 3.06 acre site, located at 10 McMurray Drive,
Assessor’s Parcel Number 137-200-087.
The property is zoned for General Commercial with an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone
(CR-AHOZ) allowing residential development with a minimum density of 25 units/net buildable
acre and minimum 20% affordability. The Project proposes to provide 88 units affordable to
households with income qualifying as “very-low” and “low”. For a single-person household in
2023, the income limits were $37,550 in gross annual income to qualify as “very-low income”
and $60,100 to qualify as “low income”.
The proposed development includes:
• Agrarian style architecture
• Two three-story apartment buildings, with 30 one-bedroom units, 37 two-bedroom units,
and 22 three-bedroom units
• A community room and kitchen, learning center, and computer lab for residents
• Staff offices for the resident property manager, a visiting licensed social worker/resident
services providers, and one floating office space for guest service providers
• Outdoor courtyards with half basketball court, play structure, shaded seating areas, and
BBQ and picnic areas
• 148 total parking spaces, of which 15 are electric vehicle charging spaces
• Landscaping and lighting
• Cul-de-sac for the McMurray terminus
• Connection path to River Trail easement on southern adjacent parcel
In accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act and the
Environmental Impact Report Guidelines of the City of Buellton (collectively, “CEQA”), the City
prepared an Initial Study and a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the project.
