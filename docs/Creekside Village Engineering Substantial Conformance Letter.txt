Dear Lonnie, 
 
Per your request, we have reviewed the updated conceptual drawings for the above referenced parcel by RRM Design Group, dated October 27, 2023.  The purpose of this review was to determine if the grading & drainage designs associated with the approved entitlement documents, specifically the Preliminary Grading Plan and Storm Water Control Plan, are applicable to the updated plans. 
 
Upon review, there has been a reduction in the overall building footprint and a shift of some of the parking from an interior to exterior.  This would potentially allow more permeable surfaces and underground runoff storage volume.  Therefore, the approved design would be considered a conservative estimate for planning purposes.  Therefore, we consider the approved grading and drainage designs consistent with the proposed updates. 
 
 
Sincerely 
 

 
 
 
Russell J. Garrison P.E.
