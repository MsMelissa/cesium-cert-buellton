Village Senior Apartments
Planning Projects
The proposed Village Senior Apartments Project consists of the construction of a new 50-unit senior affordable residential development on a 2 acre site, located at 332 & 334 Valley Vineyard Circle, Assessor’s Parcel Number 137-790-008.
This is one of the two planned residential projects within the Village Specific Plan area (Vineyard Village Townhomes and Village Senior Apartments). The apartments would be available to individuals who are 55 years of age and older and are able to live independently. The Project would provide 49 units affordable to seniors who income qualify, and one market-rate manager’s unit. Some units would be available specifically for veterans.
For questions on availability of the veteran units, contact the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara, Darcy Brady: darcybrady@hasbarco.org. For availability of all other units, contact Leda Martinez: ledamartinez@hasbarco.org.
The proposed development includes: • Ranch style architecture • 2 two-story apartment buildings, with 44 one-bedroom units and 6 two-bedroom units • A community room, outdoor courtyard, and community garden for residents • 68 vehicle parking spaces and 50 bicycle parking spaces • Landscaping and decorative lighting • New bus stop on Valley Vineyard Circle in front of the buildings • Connection path to trail around the Village Townhomes and to Village Park
In accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act and the Environmental Impact Report Guidelines of the City of Buellton (collectively, “CEQA”), the City prepared a Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the Oak Springs Village Specific Plan, which the Project is adequately addressed under.
