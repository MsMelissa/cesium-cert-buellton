street frontage, likes the market but is concerned with the slight asymmetry of the building design; suggested adding an outdoor dining feature to the side of the market to break up the asymmetry of the building and provide landscaping on the backside to reduce massing and improve views from Flying Flags. She stated she had concerns with the coffee shop drive through circulation and can see that it could be a popular destination for residents and travelers. 
. Commissioner Contreras stated that the project reminds him of architecture in the Palm Springs area and voiced concerns regarding the Applicants reportedly contentious relationship with Rancho de Maria residents and hopes those issues resolve.  Mr. Contreras noted concerns with traffic and looks forward to the required traffic study. He applauds the Applicant for moving forward with this 
project. He described the project as an “Americana” piece. 
. Chair Mercado stated that this project is much better than the first concept.  Had concerns about increase in square footage and was informed the additional square footage is incorporated in the hotel feature.  Mr. Mercado likes the convertible component with the hotel.  Encouraged additional landscaping especially in the trail area.   In closing he stated this is a much better project than what was previously presented and that there is nothing in the Valley like it; appreciates the effort put into designing an iconic development for Buellton. 
Mr. St. George thanked the Commission for pushing back as he would have gone with the first concept which wouldn’t have been nearly as exciting.  He stated that Buellton is perfect for this Americana project and is very excited to move forward.
