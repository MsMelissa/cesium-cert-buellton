CITY OF BUELLTON Planning Commission Agenda Staff Report  
Planning Director Review: Planning Commission Agenda Item No:  AK 2  
To:  The Honorable Chair and Commission Members  
From:  Andrea Keefer, Planning Director  
Date:  February 15, 2024  
Subject:  Resolution No. 24-02 -“A Resolution of the Planning Commission of the City of Buellton, California, Recommending City Council Approval of a One-Year Time Extension (24-TE-01) Request for Final Development Plan (16-FDP-06) Located at the Southern Terminus of Industrial Way on Assessor’s Parcel Number 099-690-048, and Making Findings in Support Thereof”  

BACKGROUND 
An application has been submitted by Lonnie Roy, applicant on behalf of SBID, LLC, owner, for a one-year time extension (24-TE-01) for the previously-approved Buellton Hub Project located at the southerly terminus of Industrial Way, Assessor’s Parcel Numbers (“APN”) 099-690-048 (Attachment 1 -Vicinity Map). The time extension request is for the Final Development Plan (16-FDP-06) (Attachment 2–Application). Approved project plans are included as Attachment 3. 
On January 18, 2018, the Planning Commission adopted Resolution No. 18-02 recommending approval of the Final Development Plan (16-FDP-06) and Tentative Tract Map (TTM 31061) (Attachment 4). City Council subsequently adopted Resolution No. 18-03, approving the Final Development Plan and Tentative Tract Map on February 22, 2018 (Attachment 5). A time extension request for the Tentative Tract Map has been being processed separately, and is therefore not a part of this request. 
Final development plans expire after 5 years (See Buellton Municipal Code Section 
19.08.120.H (2)). Notwithstanding the general time limits set by the Buellton Municipal Code, the Code does allow an applicant to apply for up to two one-year time extensions for the Final Development Plan. This is the second request for a one-year time extension for the Final Development Plan. If approved, this would be the final extension for the Final Development Plan allowed per the Buellton Municipal Code. 
The Final Development Plan was set to expire on February 22, 2024, however the applicant applied for a time extension on January 19, 2024, in advance of the date of expiration. 
Time Extension (24-TE-01) Page 2 February 15, 2024 
The Planning Commission may, upon good cause shown, recommend approval of the time extension to the City Council for one year. Staff is unaware of any reason to deny the extension, and it is reasonable that the Planning Commission recommend approval of the request at this time. The original applicant for 16-FDP-06 and TTM 31061 was Peter Hauber, prior property owner, and Gavin Moores, agent. The property has since been acquired by SBID, LLC, of which Lonnie Roy is the agent. 
Given the current property owner’s expressed desire to retain property entitlements and considering that the applicant has been working toward obtaining required permits to begin work on the site associated with the development project, Staff considers the time extension request to be reasonable. 
RECOMMENDATION 
That the Planning Commission consider the adoption of Resolution No. 24-02 -“A Resolution of the Planning Commission of the City of Buellton, California, Recommending City Council Approval of a One-Year Time Extension (24-TE-01) Request for Final Development Plan (16-FDP-06) Located at the Southern Terminus of Industrial Way, Assessor’s Parcel Numbers 099-690-048, and Making Findings in Support Thereof”
