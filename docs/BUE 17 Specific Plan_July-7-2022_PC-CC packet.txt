Subject:  Preparation of Specific Plan for BUE-17 Mixed-Use Development; Southern Terminus of Industrial Way (APN 099-690-048)  

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION 
On behalf of property owner SBID, LLC, (Edward St. George, Member), Lonnie Roy and Gavin Moores (Applicants) have submitted an application to initiate preparation of a Specific Plan for the proposed BUE-17 mixed-use development (“Project”), located on APN 099-690-048, as depicted in Attachment 1 – Vicinity Map. The parcel has zoning and land use designations of M (Industrial) and OS (Open Space), and is currently entitled as the “Buellton Hub” mixed-use project.” 
The 17.22-acre project site is located at the southern terminus of Industrial Way, between Industrial Way on the west, and the Rancho de Maria subdivision on the east. The site is undeveloped land, generally flat with sloping topography towards the Santa Ynez River, located to the south; Zaca Creek runs along the west and north sides of the property. 
The subject property has existing entitlements, approved in February 2018, for Final Development Plan (16-FDP-06) and Tentative Tract Map (TTM 31061) for a mixed-use development, including airspace condominiums; a Mitigated Negative Declaration (17-MND-03) and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program for the Buellton Hub project was also adopted. The property has since been sold to the current Owner, who is proceeding to fulfill conditions of approval for the tentative tract map (TTM 31061), particularly the engineering conditions that are applicable prior to grading permit issuance; once these conditions are satisfied, the Owner intends to undertake rough grading of the site. . 
Meanwhile, the Applicant has presented conceptual plans for a modified version of the Buellton Hub development plan to both Planning Commission (on April 7, 2022) and City Council (on June 9, 2022). Subsequently, on June 21, 2022, an application to initiate preparation of a Specific Plan to potentially accommodate the modified development plan has been submitted to the Planning Department. The Applicant’s letter regarding the specific plan preparation request is set forth in Attachment 2. Based on information provided by the Applicant, preliminary land use statistics regarding the proposed development are summarized below:

Specific Plan Methodology 
The Applicant has submitted the required fee deposit for a Combined Application (Concurrent General Plan, Rezone, and/or Specific Plan) in order initiate the specific plan preparation process as set forth in Buellton Municipal Code (BMC) 19.08.140. The purpose of tonight’s meeting is in compliance with BMC 190.8.140.C, which calls for a joint meeting of the Planning Commission and City Council to prescribe the specific methodology to be employed in preparing the specific plan. This meeting is required to be conducted within 30 days of initiating the Specific Plan process; for the subject Project, the initiation date is considered to be the application submittal date of June 21, 2022. 
The Applicant has requested that they be the preparer of the Specific Plan, and has submitted a draft Table of Contents which outlines the proposed scope of the Plan (see Attachment 2). While Staff concurs with the general format and outline of the document, the following additional items are recommended to be addressed in the Plan:

A draft outline for the Specific Plan is set forth in Attachment 3 hereto, which reflects a redlined version of the Applicant’s proposed table of contents along with Staff’s preliminary comments. 
City Staff would oversee the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) analysis for the Specific Plan. Staff has conducted a preliminary review of the Project and will arrange for the preparation of an Initial Study to determine whether an environmental impact report (EIR) or mitigated negative declaration (MND) would be prepared. In order to inform the findings for the Initial Study, the following technical studies will be required at a minimum (others may be determined during the review process): 
. 
Traffic, Circulation, & Parking 

. 
Noise 

. 
Air Quality & Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

. 
Biological Resources 

. 
Others (TBD) 


Preparation of the Initial Study and technical studies will be done by outside consultants. Staff will proceed to obtain cost estimates and timelines for preparation of the Initial Study; and will require the Applicant to submit a fee deposit equal to 5% of the contract amount in order to commence the work. 
In the event that the Applicant has arranged to have technical studies prepared by their own consultants, the City will arrange for peer review of the studies; Applicant shall identify which studies it is preparing. Staff will obtain cost estimates for either preparation of the applicable study or peer review. The Applicant will be required to submit a fee deposit equivalent to 5% of contract amount in order to commence the work. 
Total costs associated with preparation of either an MND or EIR will be established once the level of environmental review has been determined through the Initial Study process.

City of Buellton 107 West Highway 246 P.O. Box 1819 Buellton, CA 93427 
RE: Campus 36, APN 099-690-048 
On Behalf of the property owner, we are pleased to submit this application to initiate the 
specific plan process for the proposed Campus 36 (“Project”) project consistent with the Buellton Municipal Code (“BMC”)Section 19.08.140.B. Therefore, we are requesting that 
City Staff convenes a joint meeting of the planning commission and city council to prescribe the specific plan methodology and declare its findings by resolution within the 30 days and 60 days requirements as prescribed in BMC Section 19.08.140.C. 
Specific Plan Process Request/Suggestions 
The Applicant requests that they be the preparer of the Specific Plan working closely with City Staff, while City Staff will conduct the CEQA analysis for the Specific Plan. The Applicant suggests that the CEQA analysis be a project-level analysis for the proposed Project even though the Specific Plan will allow for a broader range of uses. The Applicant suggests that the Specific Plan be a development standards-focused document that facilities the proposed Project. Attachment A includes a draft table of contents which shows the general topics and organization that the Applicant suggests the specific plan cover. 
The Project was reviewed in concept by Planning Commission on April 7th, 2022, and City Council on June 9th, 2022, which both received favorable responses. In addition, the Applicant conducted a community-wide public meeting for the Project on November 20th, 2021, and a meeting with the Rancho de Maria community on May 12th, 2022. The Applicant will continue working with Rancho De Maria to alleviate their concerns about the Project and incorporate negotiated elements into the Specific Plan. The Applicant will keep City Staff informed of all public outreach meetings and requests that they are allowed to conduct these meetings and report back to the City independently. 
Timing 

The Applicant would like to discuss the specific plan and CEQA schedule further with City Staff. It is reasonable to assume that the project will require a MND as the prior project considering the project footprint is the same and trip generation does not exceed the prior project. The Applicant requests that the specific plan and CEQA analysis be on a nine to twelve week schedule following the resolution adopting the methodology. The specific plan initiation process is anticipated to be complete by 8/9/2022. Therefore it is expected that the specific plan process will be completed on approximately 10/10/22. It is anticipated that the Specific Plan will go to the planning commission in November and city council in December. The development plan for the Project will likely follow the specific plan hearings by a month or two, going to the planning commission likely in 
December or January. See Attachment B for a copy of the Applicant’s entitlement 
planner for reference. 
Conclusion 
We appreciate your careful review of the proposed Project and assistance in guiding the Project through the process. Please do not hesitate to contact our offices should you have any questions or require additional materials for this request.
