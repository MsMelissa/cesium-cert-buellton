Polo Village
Planning Projects
The Polo Village Project consists of the construction of a new 49-unit multi-family residential development on a 2.16 acre site, located at 560 McMurray Drive, Assessor’s Parcel Number 137-090-067.
The property is zoned for General Commercial with an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (CR-AHOZ) allowing residential development with a minimum density of 25 units/net buildable acre and minimum 20% affordability. The Project proposes to provide 48 units affordable to households with income qualifying as “very-low” and “low.” For a single-person household in 2023, the income limits are $37,550 in gross annual income to qualify as “very-low income” and $60,100 to qualify as “low income.”
The proposed development includes:
● Mission Revival style architecture
● Two three-story apartment buildings, with 6 one-bedroom units, 30 two-bedroom units, and 12 three-bedroom units, ranging in size from 604 to 1,003 square feet of living area
● A three-story community building with one three-bedroom manager's unit
● An outdoor recreation area with a playground, multi-sport ball court, BBQ, and picnic area
● 81 total parking spaces, of which 8 are Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
● Landscaping and lighting
The Project qualifies under Senate Bill 35 (SB 35), which grants qualifying projects a streamlined, ministerial permitting process. For an SB 35 project, a local government may only apply objective development and design standards, and cannot require a public hearing to be held for discretionary approval of the project. The Project also qualifies under the State Density Bonus Law for requests to be granted on decreased parking and concessions on development standards, which include exceptions to fencing, landscaping, and screening standards.
In accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act and the Environmental Impact Report Guidelines of the City of Buellton (collectively, “CEQA”), the proposed Project is exempt from environmental review, as it is a ministerial project. Important Dates
