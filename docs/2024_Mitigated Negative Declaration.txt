INTRODUCTION 
LEGAL AUTHORITY 
This Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) has been prepared in accordance with the CEQA Guidelines and relevant provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of 1970, as amended.  
Initial Study. Section 15063(c) of the CEQA Guidelines defines an Initial Study as the proper preliminary method of analyzing the potential environmental consequences of a project. The purposes of an Initial Study are: 
(1) 
To provide the Lead Agency with the necessary information to decide whether to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Mitigated Negative Declaration; 

(2) 
To enable the Lead Agency to modify a project, mitigating adverse impacts, thus avoiding the need to prepare an EIR; and 

(3) 
To provide sufficient technical analysis of the environmental effects of a project to permit a judgment based on the record as a whole, that the environmental effects of a project have been adequately mitigated. 


IMPACT ANALYSIS AND SIGNIFICANCE CLASSIFICATION 
The following sections of this IS/MND provide discussions of the possible environmental effects of the proposed project for specific issue areas that have been identified in the CEQA Initial Study Checklist.  For each issue area, potential effects are isolated. 
A “significant effect” is defined by Section 15382 of the CEQA Guidelines as “a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by a project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.” According to the CEQA Guidelines, “an economic or social change by itself shall not be considered a significant effect on the environment, but may be 
considered in determining whether the physical change is significant.”

Owner: City of Buellton 107 West Highway 246 Buellton, California  93427 
PROJECT SITE CHARACTERISTICS 
Location and Surrounding Land Uses: The 24-acre City-owned property is located generally southeast of River View Park, and south of the southern end of Valley Dairy Road. The property consists of five parcels (APNs 099-660-032, -033, -034, -035, and 099-670-005, the “Site”).  The site is divided into a 4-acre upper (northerly) portion and a 20-acre lower (southerly) portion.  
The 4-acre upper (northern) portion of the Site is developed land that currently contains a 3,200­square foot residence, a former dairy barn (approx. 7,000 sf, designated as a historic structure by the City), and a 1,600 sf open storage shed. 
The 20-acre lower (southern) portion of the Site is currently vacant disturbed land, except for a 1.25-acre SYV Horseback Ride facility consisting of horse corrals and a small office structure with storage; 10 – 12 unpaved parking spaces are provided in a vacant field immediately west of the equestrian facility which operates under a conditional use permit from the City. This lower portion of the Site was formerly used for hay farming, but has since been vacant for the past 8 to 10 years. The land is cleared and mowed regularly; it is occasionally used for overflow parking when there are large events at the River View Park complex, with access via existing dirt and gravel roads.

Surrounding uses include: existing residential uses in the R zone to the north; Buellton’s River View Park, including Santa Ynez Valley Botanic Garden, to the west/north-west; the City’s wastewater treatment facility and open space to the southeast with industrial and commercial uses in the M zone beyond that to the east of the site. The Santa Ynez River is located to the south beyond the City limits, which is coterminous with the southern property line. The river flows generally from southeast to northwest, approximately 700 feet south of the project site, and is separated by an earthen berm along the Santa Ynez River area at the southern property line. 
. See Appendix A for a map showing the project location. 
Existing General Plan Designation (Land Use Category) and Zoning: The northern 4 acres of the site has a General Plan designation of Low Density Residential, with a zoning designation of Single-Family Residential (RS-6). The southern 20 acres of the site has a General Plan designation of Open Space, Parks and Recreation, with a zoning designation of Open Space (OS). 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The proposed project consists of a phased capital improvement project to construct a multi­purpose recreational facility and to repurpose existing buildings for use as an event facility, children’s museum and library/community room facility on a 24+/-acre City-owned site (APNs 099-660-032, -033, -034, -035, & 099-670-005, the “Site”) adjacent to the existing River View Park complex. The Site is divided into a 4-acre Upper Portion and a 20-acre Lower Portion. In addition, a new paved access driveway is proposed from the River View Park east paved parking lot to the north-west, across a portion of adjacent City-owned land (APN 099-670-004.) 
Phasing and proposed uses are described below. Existing roadway access to the Upper Portion is from Dairyland Road via Valley Dairy Road. Access to Lower Portion would be from River View Park via Sycamore Drive.  Interior circulation utilizes primarily existing dirt and gravel roads; in Phase 2, a short paved interior access driveway to the lower parking lot is proposed. 
The project site plan shows that proposed uses and site development activities are to be located primarily outside of the dripline of mature existing trees, including “protected trees” as set forth in BMC Chapter 12.32, “The Native Tree Protection Ordinance”. Outdoor recreational activities will be situated to take advantage of the natural canopies, aesthetics, and/or other unique characteristics provided by existing mature tree stands.  In Phase 1, removal of protected trees would be avoided.  The future interior access driveway to the lower parking lot (further described below in Phase 2 uses) may result with removal of landscape plantings; in the remaining Phase 2 area, removal of protected trees would be avoided. 
. See Appendix B for Site Plans of Existing Conditions and Phase 1 & 2 Proposed Uses 
PHASE 1 Time Frame: estimated 1 – 2 Years Proposed uses would include: 
On 4-acre Upper Portion 
. Library/Community rooms within an existing residence (about 3,200 sf) converted to that use.  Conversion consists of interior tenant improvements and related access requirements. 
City of Buellton 
4 
. 
Wedding/Event facility in existing historic Barn (about 7,000 sf) includes warming kitchen and 2nd floor apartment space. Large events (up to 200 persons per event) to be held about 1-2 times per month, with potentially more frequent smaller events. 

. 
Santa Ynez Valley Children’s Outdoor Museum – The initial outdoor play area measures approx. 0.8 acre (34,848 +/-sf) of primarily open space area on the upper lot and hillside areas, including 1,600 sf of existing covered space (current open storage shed to be renovated). Portable restroom facilities (trailer) and play equipment to be installed. Proposed uses and  placement of accessory equipment will avoid adverse impacts to protected trees 

. 
Staff and disabled parking area for these uses (number of spaces to be determined). On 20-acre Lower Portion 

. 
Paved lower parking lot (about 1.5 acres) with about 112 parking spaces. This area is vacant disturbed land (former dairy, pasture and agriculture fields, currently used to accommodate overflow parking for events held at Riverview Park). 

. 
Temporary access to the parking lot would be via an existing network of interior dirt/gravel driveways from the River View Park east parking lot. (Note: these driveways are currently used by the existing horseback ride facility and overflow parking areas) 

. 
A retention basin for new construction is proposed immediately south of the lower parking lot. 


PHASE 2 Time Frame: estimated 2 to 5+ Years Proposed uses would include: 
On 20-acre Lower Portion 
. 
Permanent access to lower parking lot via a new, paved interior driveway from the River View Park east parking lot.  The driveway would cross a mapped drainage stream and its construction may result with removal of landscape plantings in the affected area; any applicable mitigation would be on-site. 

. 
Sport facilities/play fields (about 15 acres) with the following amenities: 

o 
2 full-sized soccer fields, 1 mid-sized field and 1 small sized soccer field; 

o 
baseball/softball field; 

o 
2 pickleball/multi-use courts; 

o 
Supplemental parking (estimated 40 spaces alongside existing interior gravel road near southwesterly property line ); and 

o 
Restroom facility (modular building) 



. 
Soccer fields could potentially accommodate small regional tournaments (4 per year maximum anticipated). Tournaments to be held in this location are expected to relocate here from other less desirable sites in the Santa Ynez Valley that are currently used for soccer tournaments. On the day of the event, each tournament could generate up to an estimated 2,150 vehicle trips, comparable to other large events held periodically at Riverview Park. Each of the regional soccer tournaments would require special event permits from the City; circulation, parking management and other applicable temporary impacts would be addressed at that time. 

. 
Possible 0.2 acre (approx. 8,712 sf) expansion of Children’s Museum outdoor open space play area, consisting of additional land along the easterly property line between the drainage ditch and the existing interior gravel road 


City of Buellton 
5 
. 2.5 acres to remain undeveloped (near the berm along south boundary of property/well area) 
Refer to Appendix B for site plan exhibits of existing conditions, proposed uses individually for Phase 1 and Phase 2, and a composite of proposed uses for both Phase 1 & 2.  
PUBLIC AGENCIES WHOSE APPROVAL MAY BE REQUIRED FOR SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS (e.g. permits, financing approval, or participation agreement): 
To Be Determined. Resource agencies to be potentially consulted: -California Dept. of Fish & Wildlife and Regional Water Quality Control Board -U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service -Other (as applicable)

EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 
1) A brief explanation is required for all answers except "No Impact" answers that are adequately supported by the information sources a Lead Agency cites in the parentheses following each question. A "No Impact" answer is adequately supported if the referenced information sources show that the impact simply does not apply to projects like the one involved (e.g., the project falls outside a fault rupture zone). A "No Impact" answer should be explained where it is based on project-specific factors as well as general standards (e.g., the project will not expose sensitive receptors to pollutants, based on a project-specific screening analysis). 
2) All answers must take account of the whole action involved, including off-site as well as on-site, cumulative as well as project-level, indirect as well as direct, and construction as well as operational impacts. 
3) "Potentially Significant Impact" is appropriate if there is substantial evidence that an effect may be significant. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant Impact" entries when the determination is made, an EIR is required. 
4) "Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated" applies where the incorporation of mitigation measures has reduced an effect from "Potentially Significant Impact" to a "Less Than Significant Impact." The lead agency must describe the mitigation measures, and briefly explain how they reduce the effect to a less than significant level. 
5) Earlier analyses may be used where, pursuant to the tiering, program EIR, or other CEQA process, an effect has been adequately analyzed in an earlier EIR or negative declaration. Section 15063(c)(3)(D).  Earlier analyses and references are discussed at the end of the checklist. 
6) Lead agencies are encouraged to incorporate into the checklist references to information sources for potential impacts (e.g., general plans, zoning ordinances). Reference to a previously prepared or outside document should, where appropriate, include a reference to the page or pages where the statement is substantiated. 
7) Supporting Information Sources: A source list should be attached, and other sources used or individuals contacted should be cited in the discussion. 
8) The analysis of each issue should identify: 
a) 
the significance criteria or threshold used to evaluate each question; and 

b) 
the mitigation measure identified, if any, to reduce the impact to less than significance

ISSUES:  Potentially Significant Impact  Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated  Less Than Significant Impact  No Impact  
I. AESTHETICS -Would the project:  
a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?  X  
b) Damage scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway?  X  
c) In non-urbanized areas, Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of public views of the site and its surroundings? (Public views are those that are experienced from publicly accessible vantage point). If the project is in an urbanized area, would the project conflict with applicable zoning and other regulations governing scenic quality?  X  
d) Create a new source of substantial light or glare which would adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area?  X  

a., b. Scenic Vistas/Resources: No roadways in the project area are designated as state or local scenic highways. The project site is located along a suburban-open space interface / transitional area, bounded by low density residential uses to the north, open space & existing park complex to the south/southwest, and industrial/commercial uses to the east. The Site itself is considered a local open space and scenic resource, including a locally designated historic barn. The proposed project would preserve the barn and open space within the City; it would also create enhanced community resources and recreational amenities for residents and visitors to enjoy while experiencing the natural scenery of the surrounding area. Development of the project would not block any scenic vistas from other properties. No adverse impacts would result. 
c. Visual Quality: Development of the project site would result in repurposing of existing buildings, as well as installation of new parking areas, sports fields, ancillary accessory structures (restrooms), and landscaping that would replace a partially developed and vacant open space parcel bounded on the north and east by existing residential and commercial/industrial uses,and the City’s River View Park complex to the west. 
The impact is considered less than significant for the following reasons: 1) the project will repurpose/renovate existing buildings, will expand on an existing City park and active recreational complex to the west, and will conform to the requirements of the Community Design Guidelines as may be applicable; and 2) is located within an area designated for low-density single-family and open space uses under the existing General Plan which are complementary to the proposed parks and recreation uses. 
d. Light and Glare: The project site currently has no street lighting or nighttime activity that is lighted. Current lighting sources surrounding the project site include sporadic lighting from nearby industrial uses. No nighttime activities are anticipated on the site, and the sports fields will not be lighted. If minimal security lighting is required for the parking lot area or buildings, it would adhere to Zoning Ordinance requirements for Dark Sky Compliant lighting. Impacts would be less than significant. 
City of Buellton 
11 
Findings and Mitigation:  Impacts would be less than significant, so no mitigation is required. 
ISSUES:  Potentially Significant Impact  Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated  Less Than Significant Impact  No Impact  
II. AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY RESOURCES -Would the project:  
a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance (Farmland) to nonagricultural use?  X  
b) Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a Williamson Act contract?  X  
c) Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause rezoning of, forest land (per Public Resources Code § 12220(g), timberland (Public Resources Code § 4526, or timberland zoned Timberland Production (per Govt Code §51104(g))?  X  
d) Result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest land to non-forest use?  X  
e) Involve other changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could result in conversion of Farmland, to non­agricultural use or conversion of forest land to non-forest use?  X  

a. through e. Farmland, Forest Land, Timberland: The site is located in a transitional area between suburban and open space uses and is not designated as farmland in the City’s General Plan, or Zoning Ordinance. The City is not near any designated forest lands. The property is not subject to a Williamson Act contract. 
Findings and Mitigation: No impacts would occur, therefore, no mitigation is required. 
ISSUES:  Potentially Significant Impact  Potentially Significant Unless Mitigation Incorporated  Less than Significant Impact  No Impact  

III. AIR QUALITY -Would the project:  
a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan?  X  
b) Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard (including releasing emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone precursors)?  X  
c) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations?  X

The air quality section has been prepared by Ambient under contract to the City of Buellton. All data used in the creation of this section is on file at the Buellton Planning Department and is hereby incorporated by reference into this Initial Study. Table numbers, figure numbers and appendix numbers shown in this section correspond to the May 2023 Air Quality Assessment prepared by Ambient, and included in in Appendix C to this Initial Study. 
Setting 
The federal and state Clean Air Acts (42 United States Code §7401 et seq. and the California Health and Safety Code §40910, et seq.) empower federal and state governments to regulate emissions of airborne pollutants and have established ambient air quality standards for the protection of public health. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency designated to administer federal air quality regulation, while the California Air Resources Board (ARB) is the state equivalent and operates under the auspices of the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA). Local control in air quality management is provided by the ARB through county-level or regional (multi-county) air pollution control districts. The ARB establishes statewide air quality standards and is responsible for enforcing standards and regulating stationary sources. The ARB has established 15 air basins statewide. 
The City of Buellton is located within the South Central Coast Air Basin (SCCAB), which includes all of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties and is within the jurisdiction of the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (SBCAPCD). The climate of SCAAB is strongly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and the location of the semi-permanent high-pressure cell in the northeastern Pacific. With a Mediterranean-type climate, the area is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool winters with occasional rainy periods. Annual precipitation averaged 22 inches per year between 1981 and 2010, with most rainfall between November and March. Average monthly temperatures range from a high of 92 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) in August to a low of 38°F in December (U.S. Climate Data, 2016). 
Criteria Air Pollutants 
For the protection of public health and welfare, the Clean Air Act (CAA) required that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for various pollutants. These pollutants are referred to as “criteria” pollutants because the U.S. EPA publishes criteria documents to justify the choice of standards. These standards define the maximum amount of an air pollutant that can be present in ambient 
air without harm to the public’s health. An ambient air quality standard is generally specified as 
City of Buellton 
13 
a concentration averaged over a specific time period, such as one hour, eight hours, 24 hours, or one year. The different averaging times and concentrations are meant to protect against different exposure effects. The CAA allows states to adopt additional or more health-protective standards. The air quality regulatory framework and ambient air quality standards are discussed in greater detail later in this report. 
Federal and state standards have been established for eleven criteria pollutants, including ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter less than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter (PM10 and PM2.5), lead (Pb), sulfates, vinyl chloride (chloroethene), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and visibility reducing particles (VRP). California air quality standards are identical to or stricter than federal standards for all criteria pollutants. Table AQ-1 in Appendix C summarizes these pollutants.  
Human Health & Welfare Effects 
Common air pollutants and associated adverse health and welfare effects are summarized in Table AQ-1. Within the SCCAB, the air pollutants of primary concern, with regard to human health, include ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), and carbon monoxide (CO). As depicted in Table AQ-1, exposure to increased pollutant concentrations of O3, PM, and CO can result in various heart and lung ailments, cardiovascular and nervous system impairment, and death. 
Odors 
Typically, odors are generally regarded as an annoyance rather than a health hazard. However, 
manifestations of a person’s reaction to foul odors can range from psychological (i.e., irritation, 
anger, or anxiety) to the physiological, including circulatory and respiratory effects, nausea, vomiting, and headache. 
Neither the state nor the federal governments have adopted rules or regulations for the control of odor sources. The SBCAPCD does not have an individual rule or regulation that specifically addresses odors; however, odors would be applicable to SBCAPCD Rule 303, Nuisance. Any actions related to odors would be based on citizen complaints to local governments and the SBCAPCD. The SBCAPCD recommends that odor impacts be addressed in a qualitative manner. Such analysis shall determine if the project results in excessive nuisance odors, as defined under the California Code of Regulations, Health & Safety Code Section 41700, air quality public nuisance. 
Toxic Air Contaminants 
Toxic air contaminants (TACs) are air pollutants that may cause or contribute to an increase in mortality or serious illness, or which may pose a hazard to human health. TACs are usually present in minute quantities in the ambient air, but due to their high toxicity, they may pose a threat to public health even at very low concentrations. Asbestos, for example, is a considered a TAC. Because there is no threshold level below which adverse health impacts are not expected to occur, TACs differ from criteria pollutants for which acceptable levels of exposure can be determined and for which state and federal governments have set ambient air quality standards. TACs, therefore, are not considered “criteria pollutants” under either the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) or the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) and are thus not subject to National or State Ambient Air Quality Standards (AAQS).

For further discussion of TACs, please refer to Appendix C. 
Regulatory Framework 
Federal. At the federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been 
charged with implementing national air quality programs. The U.S. EPA’s air quality mandates 
are drawn primarily from the FCAA, which was signed into law in 1970. Congress substantially amended the FCAA in 1977 and again in 1990. 
The Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) required the U.S. EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and also set deadlines for their attainment. Two types of NAAQS have been established: primary standards, which protect public health, and secondary standards, which protect public welfare from non-health-related adverse effects, such as visibility restrictions. NAAQS are summarized in Table AQ-2 in Appendix C. 
State of California. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) is the agency responsible for coordination and oversight of state and local air pollution control programs in California and for implementing the CCAA of 1988. Other ARB duties include monitoring air quality (in conjunction with air monitoring networks maintained by air pollution control districts and air quality management districts, establishing California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS), which in many cases are more stringent than the NAAQS, and setting emissions standards for new motor vehicles. The CAAQS are summarized in Table AQ-2 within Appendix C. The emission standards established for motor vehicles differ depending on various factors including the model year, and the type of vehicle, fuel, and engine used. 
Relevant state regulations include the following, which are described in more detail in Appendix C: 
. 
California Clean Air Act 

. 
Assembly Bills 1807 and 2588 – Toxic Air Contaminants 

. 
In-Use Off Road Vehicle Regulation 

. 
California Building Code 

. 
Green Building Standards 


Local. The Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (SBCAPCD) is the agency primarily responsible for ensuring that NAAQS and CAAQS are not exceeded and that air quality conditions within the region are maintained. Responsibilities of the SBCAPCD include, but are not limited to, preparing plans for the attainment of ambient air quality standards, adopting and enforcing rules and regulations concerning sources of air pollution, issuing permits for stationary sources of air pollution, inspecting stationary sources of air pollution and responding to citizen complaints, monitoring ambient air quality and meteorological conditions, and implementing programs and regulations required by the FCAA and the CCAA. 
The SBCAPCD monitors air pollutant levels and develops strategies to ensure that air quality standards are met. Depending on whether or not the standards are met or exceeded, Santa Barbara County is classified as being in “attainment” or as “non-attainment.” Currently, the basin is in attainment for all classified pollutants, except the following:

Table AQ-2 in Appendix C summarizes all relevant criteria pollutants along with their state and federal standards and attainment status. 
Impact Analysis 
Please refer to Appendix C for additional details regarding thresholds, methodology and analysis.  The discussion below focuses on the most relevant aspects of the analysis that are critical for drawing the conclusions described in the report included in Appendix C. 
a. As part of the CCAA, the SBCAPCD is required to develop a plan to achieve and maintain the state ozone standard by the earliest practicable date. The SBCAPCD 2022 Ozone Plan (Plan) addresses the attainment and maintenance of state and federal ambient air quality standards. The Plan was adopted by SBCAPCD in December 2022 (SBCAPCD 2022). 
The Plan outlines the SBCAPCD strategies to reduce ozone-precursor pollutants (i.e., ROC and NOX) from a wide variety of sources. The Plan includes a stationary-source control program, which includes control measures for permitted stationary sources; as well as, transportation and land use management strategies to reduce motor vehicle emissions. The stationary-source control program is administered by SBCAPCD. Transportation and land use control measures are implemented at the local or regional level, by promoting and facilitating the use of alternative transportation options, increased pedestrian access and accessibility to community services and local destinations, reductions in vehicle miles traveled, and promotion of congestion management efforts. In addition, local jurisdictions also prepare population forecasts, which are used by SBCAPCD to forecast population-related emissions and air quality attainment, including those contained in the Plan. 
Consistency with land use and population forecasts in local and regional plans, including the Plan, is required for projects subject to CEQA. Proposed projects subject to the most recent Plan consistency determinations include but are not limited to commercial, industrial, residential, and transportation projects. The Plan relies primarily on the land use and population projections provided by the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG) and ARB on-road 
emissions forecast as a basis for vehicle emission forecasting. The Plan uses SBCAG’s 
countywide regional transportation demand model for on-road mobile source emissions estimates and SBCAG’s socio-economic projections to form the basis for some stationary and area source growth forecasts. 
To be consistent with the standard dust mitigation measures in Section 6.1 of the SBCAPCD Scope and Content of Air Quality Sections in Environmental Documents (based on policies adopted in the 1979 Air Quality Attainment Plan [AQAP]), all projects involving earthmoving activities must implement the standard dust control measures. Implementation of standard dust control measures would be required as stated in the discussion of construction-related impacts and detailed in Mitigation Measure AQ-1. 
The proposed project would not result in an increase in population or employment that would affect regional emissions analyses. In addition, based on the traffic analysis prepared for this project, the project would have a less than significant impact on vehicle miles traveled. As a result, the proposed project would not be anticipated to adversely impact regional emissions 
City of Buellton 
16 
forecasts nor interfere with regional air quality attainment and maintenance efforts. This impact is considered less than significant. 
b. and c. Short-term emissions associated with the construction of the proposed project were calculated using the California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod), version 2020.4.0, computer program. Construction emissions were calculated assuming an estimated overall construction period of nine months, based on construction information provided. Project-specific construction information, such as activity schedules, equipment use, worker vehicle trips, and equipment load factors were not available and, therefore, were based on model defaults for Santa Barbara County. Demolition of existing structures is not anticipated to be required, however, some minor demolition may be required during renovation of the existing structures. Modeling assumptions and output files are included in Appendix C to this Initial Study. 
Long-term operational increases in emissions of criteria air pollutants were calculated using the CalEEMod, version 2020.4.0. Emissions modeling included quantification of emissions associated with area sources, energy use, and mobile sources. Area sources included the use of architectural coatings and landscape maintenance activities. Energy use included emissions associated with natural gas and electricity use. Trip generation rates were obtained from the traffic analysis prepared for the proposed project (ATE 2023). Specific fleet-mix data for the project was not available and, therefore, were based on the default fleet mix identified in CalEEMod for Santa Barbara County. 
To assist in the evaluation of air quality impacts, the SBCAPCD has developed recommended significance thresholds, which are contained in the SBCAPCD Scope and Content of Air Quality Sections in Environmental Documents (SBCAPCD 2022). For the purposes of this analysis, project emissions are considered potentially significant impacts if any of the following SBCAPCD recommended thresholds are exceeded: 
Construction Impacts 
The SBCAPCD recommends 25 tons per year for reactive organic compounds (ROC) or NOX as a guideline for determining the significance of construction impacts. In addition, the SBCAPCD recommends incorporation of standard mitigation measures to minimize localized air quality impacts commonly associated with construction activities and to ensure consistency with air quality attainment and maintenance efforts. 
Operational Impacts 
A proposed project will have a significant impact on air quality, either individually or cumulatively, if operational emissions would: 
. 
exceed the daily trigger for offsets or Air Quality Impact Analysis set in the SBCAPCD New Source Review Rule, for any pollutant (i.e., 240 pounds/day for ROC or NOx; and 80 lbs/day for PM10). There is no daily operational threshold for CO (it is an attainment pollutant) 

. 
exceed 25 pounds/day of NOx or ROC from motor vehicle trips only 

. 
would cause or contribute to a violation of any CAAQS or NAAQS (except O3) 


City of Buellton 
17 
. 
would exceed the SBCAPCD health risk public notification thresholds adopted by the SBCAPCD Board (10 excess cancer cases in a million for cancer risk and a Hazard Index of more than one (1.0) for non-cancer risk) 

. 
would be inconsistent with the latest adopted federal and state air quality plans for Santa Barbara County. 


Short-Term Construction Emissions. Construction-generated emissions are of temporary duration, lasting only as long as construction activities occur, but have the potential to represent a significant air quality impact. Construction of the proposed project would result in the temporary generation of emissions associated with paving, architectural coating application, motor vehicle exhaust associated with construction equipment and worker trips, as well as the movement of construction equipment on unpaved surfaces. Short-term construction emissions would result in increased emissions of ozone-precursor pollutants (i.e., reactive organic gases (ROG) and NOX) and emissions of PM. 
Estimated maximum annual emissions associated with construction of the proposed project are presented in Table 1 below (Table AQ-3 in Appendix C). As depicted in Table 1, the maximum annual construction-generated emissions would total approximately 0.02 tons/year of ROG and 
1.5 tons/year of NOx. Maximum annual construction emissions would not exceed the threshold of 25 tons/year. However, since Santa Barbara County violates the state standard for PM10, dust control measures are required for all projects involved in earthmoving activities regardless of the significance of the fugitive dust impacts. In addition, as discussed in the analysis related to long­term impacts, PM10 can result in nuisance impacts, including irritation of eyes and respiratory tract (refer to Table AQ-1 in Appendix C). For these reasons, construction-generated emissions would be considered to have a potentially significant impact.

Notes: See Appendix C for modeling assumptions and results. 
Mitigation Measures 
Mitigation Measure AQ-1. If a grading permit is issued for the project, the following construction mitigation measures shall be implemented to minimize short-term construction emissions. These measures shall be identified on grading site plans. 
Dust Control Measures 
a. During construction, use water trucks, sprinkler systems, or dust suppressants in all areas of 
vehicle movement to prevent dust from leaving the site and from exceeding the APCD’s limit 
of 20% opacity for greater than 3 minutes in any 60 minute period. When using water, this 
City of Buellton 
18 
includes wetting down areas as needed but at least once in the late morning and after work is  
completed for the day. Increased watering frequency should be required when sustained wind  
speed exceeds 15 mph. Reclaimed water should be used whenever possible. However,  
reclaimed water should not be used in or around crops for human consumption.  
b.  Onsite vehicle speeds shall be no greater than 15 miles per hour when traveling on unpaved  
surfaces.  
c.  Install and operate a track-out prevention device where vehicles enter and exit unpaved roads  
onto paved streets. The track-out prevention device can include any device or combination of  
devices that are effective at preventing track out of dirt such as gravel pads, pipe-grid track- 
out control devices, rumble strips, or wheel-washing systems.  
d.  If importation, exportation, and stockpiling of fill material is involved, soil stockpiled for  
more than one day shall be covered, kept moist, or treated with soil binders to prevent dust  
generation. Trucks transporting fill material to and from the site shall be tarped from the point  
of origin.  
e.  Minimize the amount of disturbed area. After clearing, grading, earthmoving, or excavation  
is completed, treat the disturbed area by watering, OR using roll-compaction, OR  
revegetating, OR by spreading soil binders until the area is paved or otherwise developed so  
that dust generation will not occur. All roadways, driveways, sidewalks etc. to be paved  
should be completed as soon as possible.  
f.  Schedule clearing, grading, earthmoving, and excavation activities during periods of low  
wind speed to the extent feasible. During periods of high winds (>25 mph) clearing, grading,  
earthmoving, and excavation operations shall be minimized to prevent fugitive dust created  
by onsite operations from becoming a nuisance or hazard.  
g.  The contractor or builder shall designate a person or persons to monitor and document the  
dust control program requirements to ensure any fugitive dust emissions do not result in a  
nuisance and to enhance the implementation of the mitigation measures as necessary to  
prevent transport of dust offsite. Their duties shall include holiday and weekend periods when  
work may not be in progress. The name and telephone number of such persons shall be  
provided to the Air Pollution Control District prior to grading/building permit issuance and/or  
map clearance.  

Plan Requirements: All requirements shall be shown on grading and building plans and/or as a separate information sheet listing the conditions of approval to be recorded with the map. 
Timing: Requirements shall be shown on plans prior to grading/building permit issuance and/or recorded with the map during map recordation. Conditions shall be adhered to throughout all grading and construction periods. 
Equipment Emissions Control Measures 
The following measures are required by state law: 
a. All portable diesel-powered construction equipment greater than 50 brake horsepower 
(bhp) shall be registered with the state’s portable equipment registration program OR 
shall obtain an APCD permit. 
b. Fleet owners of diesel-powered mobile construction equipment greater than 25 hp are subject to the California Air Resource Board (CARB) In-Use Off-Road Diesel-Fueled Fleets Regulation (Title 13, California Code of Regulations (CCR), §2449), the purpose of which is to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx), diesel particulate matter (DPM), and other criteria pollutant emissions from in-use off-road diesel-fueled vehicles. Off-road heavy-duty trucks shall comply with the State Off-Road Regulation. For more information, see www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/ordiesel/ordiesel.htm. 
City of Buellton 
19 
c. 
Fleet owners of diesel-fueled heavy-duty trucks and buses are subject to CARB’s On-Road Heavy-Duty Diesel Vehicles (In-Use) Regulation (Title 13, CCR, §2025), the purpose of which is to reduce DPM, NOx and other criteria pollutants from in-use (on-road) diesel-fueled vehicles. For more information, see www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/onrdiesel/onrdiesel.htm. 

d. 
All commercial off-road and on-road diesel vehicles are subject, respectively, to Title 13, CCR, §2449(d)(3) and §2485, limiting engine idling time. Off-road vehicles subject to the State Off-Road Regulation are limited to idling no more than five minutes. Idling of heavy-duty diesel trucks during loading and unloading shall be limited to five minutes, unless the truck engine meets the optional low-NOx idling emission standard, the truck is labeled with a clean-idle sticker, and it is not operating within 100 feet of a restricted area. 


The following measures are recommended: 
e. 
Off-road heavy-duty diesel equipment with engines meeting the CARB Tier 4 emission standards if available or Tier 3 emission standards should be used to the maximum extent feasible. 

f. 
On-road heavy-duty equipment with model year 2010 engines or newer should be used to the maximum extent feasible. 

g. 
Diesel powered equipment should be replaced by electric equipment whenever feasible. Electric auxiliary power units should be used to the maximum extent feasible. 

h. 
Equipment/vehicles using alternative fuels, such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), propane or biodiesel, should be used on-site where feasible. 

i. 
Catalytic converters shall be installed on gasoline-powered equipment, if feasible. 

j. 
All construction equipment shall be maintained in tune per the manufacturer’s specifications. 

k. 
The engine size of construction equipment shall be the minimum practical size. 

l. 
The number of construction equipment operating simultaneously shall be minimized through efficient management practices to ensure that the smallest practical number is operating at any one time. 

m. 
Construction worker trips should be minimized by requiring carpooling and by providing for lunch onsite. 

n. 
Construction truck trips should be scheduled during non-peak hours to reduce peak hour emissions whenever feasible. 

o. 
Proposed truck routes should minimize to the extent feasible impacts to residential communities and sensitive receptors. 

p. 
Construction staging areas should be located away from sensitive receptors such that exhaust and other construction emissions do not enter the fresh air intakes to buildings, air conditioners, and windows. 


Plan Requirements and Timing: Prior to grading/building permit issuance and/or map recordation, all requirements shall be shown as conditions of approval on grading/building plans, and/or on a separate sheet to be recorded with the map. Conditions shall be adhered to throughout all grading and construction periods. The contractor shall retain the Certificate of Compliance for CARB’s In-Use Regulation for Off-Road Diesel Vehicles onsite and have it available for inspection. 
City of Buellton 
20 
Monitoring: 
For any applicable grading permits and/or site disturbance for any public improvement projects involving grading, the Public Works Director will verify at the time of permit/contract issuance that Mitigation Measure AQ-1 has been incorporated into the individual project plans/permit approvals and/or recorded with maps. Public Works staff shall ensure compliance onsite.  APCD inspectors will respond to nuisance complaints. 
Significance After Mitigation 
Mitigation Measure AQ-1 would require implementation of dust-control measures for ground-disturbing activities, as well as, measures for the control of construction equipment emissions, including emissions of diesel particulate matter. Implementation of PM emission measures would reduce emissions of fugitive dust by approximately 50 percent, or more. In addition, the 
project would be required to comply with SBCAPCD’s Rule 345 for the control of fugitive dust 
associated with construction and demolition activities. Asphalt paving activities would also be required to comply with SBCAPCD’s Rule 329 for the use of cutback and emulsified asphalt paving materials, which would help to further reduce emissions of ROG. With mitigation and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, this impact would be considered less than significant. 
Long-Term Operational Emissions. Long-term operational emissions associated with the proposed project would be predominantly associated with mobile sources. To a lesser extent, emissions associated with area sources, such as landscape maintenance activities, as well as, use of electricity and natural gas would also contribute to increased operational emissions. 
Operational emissions are depicted in Table 2 (Table AQ-4 in Appendix C). As depicted in Table 2, daily operational emissions would total approximately 1.1 pounds/day of ROG, 0.8 pounds/day of NOx, and 0.3 pounds/day of PM10. Estimated daily operational emissions from all sources of ROG, NOX, and PM10 would not exceed the SBCAPCD operational thresholds of 240 pounds/day for ROC or NOx; and 80 pounds/day for PM10. As a result, this impact would be considered less than significant.

Notes: Emissions were quantified using the CalEEMod program based on data derived from the traffic analysis prepared for this project. See Appendix C for modeling assumptions and results. 
As previously noted in the previous discussion, the proposed project is not anticipated to result in substantial ground disturbance, such as grading or site preparation activities. However, in the event that ground disturbance were to occur, SBCAPCD-recommended mitigation measures would be required for the control of fugitive dust. In addition, the project would be required to 
comply with SBCAPCD’s Rule 345 for the control of fugitive dust associated with construction 
and demolition activities. Other potential sources of localized pollutants are discussed in greater detail, as follows: 
Naturally-Occurring Asbestos. The ARB identifies naturally-occurring asbestos (NOA) as a toxic air contaminant (TAC). In accordance with ARB Air Toxics Control Measure, prior to any grading activities, a geologic evaluation should be conducted to determine if NOA is present within the area that will be disturbed. If NOA is not present, an exemption request form, along with a copy of the geologic report, must be filed with the local air district. If NOA is found at the site, the applicant must comply with all requirements outlined in the Asbestos Air Toxics Control Measure. The project site is not located within an area identified as having a potential for naturally-occurring ultramafic rock and serpentine soils. As a result, this impact would be considered less than significant. 
Asbestos-Containing Materials. Demolition activities can have potential negative air quality impacts, including issues surrounding the proper handling, demolition, and disposal of asbestos-containing materials (ACM). ACM could be encountered during the renovation of existing buildings, particularly older structures constructed prior to 1970. Asbestos can also be found in various building products, including (but not limited to) utility pipes/pipelines (transit pipes or insulation on pipes). The proposed project would require the renovation of existing structures, which could result in the disturbance of ACM. As a result, this impact would be considered potentially significant. 
City of Buellton 
22 
Lead-Coated Materials. The renovation/demolition of structures with materials coated with lead-based paint can have potential negative air quality impacts and may adversely affect the health of nearby individuals. Improper handling of lead-containing materials can result in the release of lead-containing particles from the site. The proposed project would require the renovation of existing structures, which could result in the disturbance of lead-containing materials. As a result, this impact would be considered potentially significant. 
Localized PM Concentrations. Fugitive dust emissions would be primarily associated with building demolition, site preparation, grading, and vehicle travel on unpaved and paved surfaces. On-site off-road equipment and trucks would also result in short-term emissions of diesel-exhaust PM, which could contribute to elevated localized concentration at nearby receptors. Uncontrolled emissions of fugitive dust may also contribute to potential increases in nuisance impacts to nearby receptors. For these reasons, localized uncontrolled concentrations of construction-generated PM would be considered to have a potentially significant impact. 
Localized Carbon Monoxide Concentrations. Localized concentrations of CO are of primary concern in areas located near congested roadway intersections. Of particular concern are signalized intersections that are projected to operate at unacceptable levels of service (LOS) (LOS E or LOS F). The proposed project is considered a “small project” and would not have an adverse local or regional traffic impact (ATE 2023). For this reason and given the low ambient concentrations in the project area and that the area is current designated attainment for CO, implementation of the proposed project is not anticipated to contribute to localized mobile-source CO concentrations that would exceed applicable ambient air quality standards. This impact is considered less than significant. 
Toxic Air Contaminants. If a project has the potential to emit toxic air contaminants (TACs) or is located in close proximity to sensitive receptors, long-term impacts may be considered significant due to increased cancer risk for the affected population. The proposed project is not expected to include the installation of stationary sources of TACs. As a result, this impact would be considered less than significant. 
Mitigation Measures 
Mitigation Measure AQ-2. To reduce potential exposure to localized pollutant concentrations associated with construction activities, Mitigation Measure AQ-1 and the following additional measure shall be implemented: 
. Demolition of on-site structures shall comply with the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Emissions requirements (NESHAP, 40 CFR, Part 61, Subpart M) for the demolition of existing structures. The SBCAPCD is delegated authority by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement the Federal NESHAP requirements, including requirements pertaining to the handling of asbestos-containing material and lead-based paint. Prior to demolition of on-site structures, the SBCAPCD shall be notified, per NESHAP requirements. Additional information may 
be obtained at SBCAPCD’s website, URL: https://www.ourair.org/asbestos/. 
City of Buellton 
23 
Significance After Mitigation 
Required mitigation would implement dust-control measures for ground-disturbing activities, as well as measures for the control of construction equipment emissions, including emissions of diesel particulate matter. Implementation of PM emission measures would reduce emissions of fugitive dust by approximately 50 percent, or more. In addition, demolition activities would be required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements for the handling of hazardous materials, including federal NESHAP requirements. With mitigation and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, this impact would be considered less than significant. 
d. The occurrence and severity of odor impacts depend on numerous factors, including the nature, frequency, and intensity of the source; wind speed and direction; and the sensitivity of the receptors. While offensive odors rarely cause any physical harm, they still can be very unpleasant, leading to considerable distress among the public and often generating citizen complaints to local governments and regulatory agencies. Projects with the potential to frequently expose members of the public to objectionable odors would be deemed to have a significant impact. 
The proposed project would not result in the installation of any equipment or processes that would be considered major odor-emission sources. However, construction of the proposed project would involve the use of a variety of gasoline or diesel-powered equipment that would emit exhaust fumes. Exhaust fumes, particularly diesel-exhaust, may be considered objectionable by some people. In addition, pavement coatings and architectural coatings used during project construction would also emit temporary odors. However, construction-generated emissions would occur intermittently throughout the workday and would dissipate rapidly with increasing distance from the source. In addition, the project would be required to comply with SBCAPCD Rule 303 that prohibits the discharge of air contaminants or other material that would cause injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of persons. As a result, short-term construction activities would not expose a substantial number of people to frequent odorous emissions. For these reasons, potential exposure of sensitive receptors to odorous emissions would be considered less than significant. 
Findings and Mitigation: Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2 as described above would be required to address potential impacts related to air emissions. With mitigation, all emissions-related impacts would be reduced to a less than significant level. Impacts related to consistency with regional air quality plans and impacts related to odors would be less than significant without mitigation.

Setting  
The proposed project is located at 202 Dairyland Road in the City of Buellton (Figure 1). The 24-acre property is located to the west of U.S. Highway 101 at the southern terminus of Dairyland Road south of State Route 246 (Figures 2 and 3). The property was previously owned by the Willemsen family and used as a dairy farm for decades, and was purchased by the City of Buellton in 2020. The upper (northeastern) approximately 4-acres of the site has an existing residence (approx. 3,200 square feet); an historic two-story dairy barn (7,000 square feet); and, an open storage shed formerly used as a tractor barn (1,600 square feet). The lower (southwestern) approximately 20 acres of the site is within a level floodplain area that was formerly used for hay farming and is undeveloped. A portion of this area is used as a , horse

The river originates between the eastern Santa Ynez and Santa Rafael mountains and empties into the Pacific Ocean west of Lompoc. 
Methods 
KMA conducted a desktop review of natural resources databases, maps, literature and online sources to identify special-status biological resources documented from the region that may be present on or near the project site. Special-status species are those plants and animals listed, or Candidates for listing, as Threatened or Endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) under the federal Endangered Species Act (FESA); federal Birds of Conservation Concern (USFWS 2023); those listed as Threatened or Endangered under the 
California Endangered Species Act (CESA); animals designated as “Species of Special Concern,” “Fully Protected,” or “Watch List” by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife 
(CDFW); plants considered Endangered or Rare under the California Native Plant Protection Act; and, animals considered sensitive that do not have a specific listing status but which are recorded in the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB; CDFW 2023a) and/or CDFW's (2023b) Special Animals List. Rare plants are those defined as having a California Rare Plant Rank (CRPR) of 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3 or 4 (CDFW 2023c). Raptors (e.g., eagles, hawks, and owls) and their nests are protected under both federal (Migratory Bird Treaty Act [MBTA]) and state (California Department of Fish and Game 2001) regulations. Critical habitat is designated for species listed under FESA, and are areas that contain the physical or biological features which are essential to the conservation of those species and may need special management or protection. Sensitive natural communities are those native plant communities listed in the CNDDB (CDFW 2023a) as rare or of limited distribution. Although a formal delineation of drainages and wetlands was not conducted, but KMA conducted an assessment of drainages and associated riparian habitat consistent with definitions and guidance provided by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) and CDFW. 
Time-series aerial photography (Google Earth) was reviewed to obtain information on the history of land use on the site and immediate area. KMA Principal Biologist Kevin Merk conducted several focused surveys of the property on September 29 and November 11, 2022 to assess site conditions. Another survey was conducted on May 15, 2023 to assess vegetation composition on the site. All plant and animal species observed during the surveys were recorded, and identified to a sufficient level to determine rarity status. Habitat types, representing land use and plant communities, were mapped on ESRI (2023) aerial imagery. Land use types followed A Guide to Wildlife Habitats in California, which is updated through the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships (CWHR) System (California Department of Fish and Wildlife [CDFW] 2023e). Designation of plant communities generally followed Holland’s (1986) Preliminary Descriptions of the Terrestrial Natural Communities of California. Sawyer et al.'s (2009) Manual of California Vegetation and VegCAMP (CDFW 2022d) was also referenced. 
The Web Soil Survey (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2023) was used to identify the soil mapping units present within the study area. The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) was examined to evaluate the extent of any identified wetlands on the site and in the vicinity (USFWS 2023a). USGS topographic maps were also reviewed for information on hydrologic and topographic features. A query of the CNDDB was conducted to generate 
City of Buellton 
30 
occurrence records of special-status biological resources (plants, animals and sensitive natural communities) documented within five miles of the project site, which included the quadrangles:  Los Alamos, Zaca Creek, Santa Rosa Hills and Solvang. For the list of special-status species identified in the search, local distribution and ecological information was obtained from a variety of online and published sources (Jennings and Hayes 1994, Bolster 1998, Moyle et al. 2015, Thompson et al. 2016, Audubon 2023, Calflora 2023, California Native Plant Society [CNPS] 2023, California Herps 2023, The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2023a, 2023b; CDFW 2023e) and compiled within the attached Special-status Biological Resources Summary. Designated critical habitat for plant and animal species listed under FESA was identified and mapped based upon information provided in Environmental Conservation Online System (USFWS 2023b). 
Appendix F includes a list of special-status species known to occur within the project vicinity.  An evaluation of those species with potential to occur in the study area was performed based upon the suitability of habitat conditions on the property and the local distribution (geographical and elevational ranges) and specific requirements (plant communities and soils) of the species considered. Those species considered as “Potential” met the following requirements: records in the site vicinity, appropriate plant community and/or soil associations onsite, and within the elevational range of the species. If any one of the criteria used for determining potential for occurrence was not met or considered to be marginal for the site, but the other elements were present, that species was considered “Unlikely”. If onsite environmental conditions were clearly inappropriate, the particular plant was not observed during the surveys, or the species has a limited distribution that does not overlap the site, those species were considered “Not Expected”. If the onsite conditions met the requirements of any lifestage or particular life history use (i.e., foraging) for wildlife while other aspects were inappropriate for certain functions (i.e., breeding), these species were considered to have Potential to occur and the likelihood of their occurrence onsite is summarized in the table and analyzed fully with regard to species ecology in the text.  
Results 
Soils. Four soil types are present in the study area occurring in bands along the slope down to the river (Figure 3). Santa Ynez gravelly fine sandy loam, 2 to 9 percent slopes, is in the uppermost portion. This unit occurs on terraces and is a gravelly loam formed from alluvium (NRCS 2023). Most of the existing facilities are located on Mocho sandy loam, overflow, which is found in floodplains and derived from alluvium. It is a sandy loam and is well drained (NRCS 2023). Midway down the gentle slope is Camarillo, very fine sandy loam, which is also found in floodplains and derived from alluvium. This unit is somewhat poorly drained and is rated as a hydric soil (NRCS 2023). A large proportion of the study area, occupying the lower area adjacent to the river channel, is Corducci and Typic Xerofluvents, 0 to 5 percent slopes, occasionally flooded. This unit is found on stream terraces, floodplains and alluvial fans. It is a mixed alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rock. It is composed of sand, with finer grain at the surface, is somewhat excessively drained, and is not considered to be a hydric soil (NRCS 2023). 
Habitat Types. The upper portion of the site with the residence and barns was mapped as Developed/Ruderal in Figure 4. This area had structures, ornamental trees, an improved driveway and parking, and irrigated lawn. In a contiguous area downslope, an equestrian center has been developed with stables, paddocks and a portable office building. A berm along the river corridor had weedy growth of non-native species, pedestrian and horse trails, and an unimproved ranch road and was considered to be Ruderal (i.e., disturbed). Other ruderal areas 
City of Buellton 
31 
were unpaved ranch roads around the former hay field, a graded area around an old agricultural basin, and roadways/trails through the River View Park area where site access would occur.  Ruderal areas have a high percentage of bare ground and growth of weedy species, including summer mustard (Hirschfeldia incana), telegraph weed (Heterotheca grandiflora), Canadian horseweed (Erigeron canadensis), jimsonweed (Datura wrightii) and grasses characteristic of the non-native grassland habitat type. Scattered coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis) and Menzies' goldenbush (Isocoma menziesii) were becoming established on the berm and spreading out from the river channel. These anthropogenic areas and disturbed areas with a predominance of weeds are not considered to be a native plant community. The Developed/Ruderal land use type in the study area is considered Urban and Ruderal areas with a high proportion of bare ground would be considered Barren under the CWHR system (CDFW 2023e). 
The former hayfield was fallow at the time of the surveys and had sparse growth of Non-native Grassland species. This area has been disturbed by farming practices over many years and is mowed regularly, and has been disked in recent years. This long period of disturbance has resulted in a high proportion (greater than 50% of the areal cover in some areas) of bare ground and a predominance of non-native species adapted to disturbance and agricultural areas. Plants observed in this part of the site included slender wild oat (Avena barbata), wall barley (Hordeum murinum), ripgut brome (Bromus diandrus), and soft chess (Bromus hordeaceus). Although sparsely vegetated and verging on Ruderal, this habitat type was classified as Non-native Grassland as described by Holland (1986) and Wild Oats and Annual Brome Grasslands semi-natural alliance under Sawyer et al. (2009). 
Ornamental trees and shrubs were planted along the north, south and eastern edges of the property (Figure 4), and were also considered part of the Developed habitat type described above. In addition, areas of River View Park within the study area have been planted with a variety of native species as part of the landscaping efforts. Ornamental species around existing development included Peruvian pepper tree (Schinus molle) and various pines (Pinus spp.). This is an anthropogenic habitat type and would fall under Urban in the CWHR system (CDFW 2023e). The native plantings in the western part of the study area included a number of western sycamore trees (Platanus racemosa) that were installed along a constructed seasonal stream (identified on Figure 4 as an Ephemeral Stream). This small ephemeral stream directs surface runoff from surrounding developed areas towards the Santa Ynez River corridor. As shown on Figure 4, an outfall structure is present and this entire area is regularly maintained by the City of Buellton. Due to nuisance flow from irrigation runoff, a small wetland was present at the culvert outfall and consisted of several rushes (Juncus spp.) and cattails (Typha sp.).

Riparian habitat was present along the river corridor, within an old basin in the southern corner of the property, and in a band to the north of the wastewater treatment plant that slightly extended onto the site (Figure 4). The dominant species along the river corridor that extended onto the property were narrow-leaf willow (Salix exigua var. exigua), with an occassional Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) andblue elderberry (Sambucus mexicana). Coyote 
City of Buellton 
33 
brush was also present throughout the area. This habitat type along the river corridor would fall under the Southern Willow Scrub described by Holland (1986), and the Sandbar Willow Thickets or Fremont Cottonwood Forest and Woodland alliances under Sawyer et al. (2009). It is highly disturbed from historic farming and very patchy in distribution, and is mixed with coastal scrub species adapted to drier conditions. An old basin had Fremont cottonwood and what appeared to be a planted black walnut (Juglans sp.), along with a large Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis), ornamental trees/shrubs and numerous weedy species. This area merged with Ruderal habitat around the edges containing poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) and Peruvian pepper tree. A band of Riparian habitat to the north of the wastewater treatment plant that extended onto the property was dominated by arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis), along with coast live oak and coyote brush. This assemblage most closely resembles the Southern Willow Scrub described by Holland (1986). It would also fall under the arroyo willow series under Sawyer et al. (2009).  Please refer to Figure 4 for more detail.  
Special-status Plant Species. A majority of the study area, and the entire impact area, has been developed for urban (recreational), residential and dairy farm uses and the lower field has been used for hay farming. Due to this history of disturbance, there is no suitable habitat for special-status plant species to occur. There were only four species recorded within five miles in the CNDDB (Figure 5) and none of these were determined to have potential to occur onsite based upon habitat requirements and local distribution (see Special-status Biological Resources Summary). The May 2023 survey confirmed the site is highly disturbed with a predominance of weedy species, and no special status plants are present. 
Special-status Animal Species. Of the 15 special-status animal species recorded within five miles of the site in the CNDDB (Figure 6), 10 were determined to have potential to occur onsite. Although the site has been developed for urban (recreational), farming and residential uses and is unsuitable for supporting important life history functions of many of these species (i.e., breeding), the Santa Ynez River corridor has native vegetation, a water source and connectivity to other habitat areas. Several special-status animal species could inhabit the river channel and move onto the site periodically while foraging or moving through the area. Several of these species may also use the project site for breeding. These species, their status, and an evaluation of potential for occurrence are summarized below.

36 California Red-legged Frog (Rana draytonii) This species is federally Threatened and is a CDFW Species of Special Concern. It uses a variety of freshwater aquatic habitats with water deeper than two feet for breeding and foraging.  During winter rains individuals move into adjacent riparian habitats and may undergo dispersal or breeding migrations through upland habitats primarily within 1 mile of the aquatic sites in which they reside. They have been recorded in Nojoqui Creek, Zaca Creek and the Santa Ynez River as well as numerous other locations beyond five miles from the site (CDFW 2023a). Suitable aquatic habitat is present in the Santa Ynez River and wastewater treatment ponds adjacent to the study area, but no aquatic habitat is onsite. If individuals use offsite aquatic habitats, there is a chance that they could move through the study area during winter rains, but this may be unlikely given the lack of suitable cover to hide from predators. They could occupy riparian habitat onsite where there is cover for prolonged periods during the winter, but this area will not be impacted by the project. 
Northern California Legless Lizard (Anniella pulchra) This species is a CDFW Species of Special Concern that inhabits a variety of shrub and woodland habitats, generally with sandy soils but also in areas with leaf litter or cover objects that provide moisture for this fossorial animal. There are records of this species from the Purisima Hills near Buellton (CDFW 2023a) and the site is within the range of the species (Thomson et al. 2016). This species could occur year-round and breed in the Riparian habitat along the River corridor, and to a lesser degree in the Ornamental habitat that is outside the historic soil disturbance footprint. 
Southwestern (=western) Pond Turtle (Actinemys pallida [=Emys marmorata]) This species is a CDFW Species of Special Concern that inhabits aquatic habitats, such as ponds, river pools, marshes and irrigation ditches, throughout most of the year.  It uses grasslands within 500 feet of aquatic sites for nesting, and they undergo overland movements through upland habitats during the winter and when aquatic sites dry. They have been documented from the Santa Ynez River adjacent to the site (CDFW 2023a). No suitable aquatic habitat is present in the study area, but due to the proximity of the site adjacent to the river individuals could use upland habitat onsite for foraging, and potential exists for nesting to occur along the berm and outer limits of riparian scrub on the southwest property line. The open sandy soils in the area mapped as non-native grassland habitat are highly disturbed from farming and mowing, as well as horseback riding and hiking, and are unlikely to be used for nesting. 
Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo regalis) This species is on the CDFW Watch List for wintering and is a federal Bird of Conservation Concern. They occur in this region during the winter when they forage for small mammals in open habitats. There are numerous observations recorded from the Santa Ynez Valley, including within Buellton (CDFW 2023a, The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2023a). There is a slight possibility that individuals could forage over the site periodically, but a significant prey base was not observed during surveys.  They do not nest in this area. 
Prairie Falcon (Falco mexicanus) This species is on the CDFW Watch List for wintering and is a federal Bird of Conservation Concern. They occur in this region year-round where they forage in a variety of open habitats including agricultural areas and feedlots. They nest on high cliff ledges and steep bluffs overlooking open areas. There are numerous records from the Santa Ynez Valley and one recent 
City of Buellton 
37 
observation from River View Park (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2023a). They could forage onsite periodically but there is no suitable nesting habitat in the area. 
Purple Martin (Progne subis) This species is a CDFW Species of Special Concern for nesting, and they nest in coniferous and sycamore woodlands or within artificial structures. Foraging is within developed areas, parks, fields, dunes, riparian areas and woodland. They occur in this area during the breeding season. Although historically recorded as breeding in the Santa Ynez Valley (CDFW 2023a), all recent breeding records are from Quiota and Alisal creeks, which are not in close proximity to the site (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2023a). Individuals could occur as transients while moving around the area. 
Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus) This species is both federally and state listed as Endangered. This species is dependent on riparian habitat with dense willows. They are neotropical migrants that formerly bred in this region but now only occur in the spring and fall.  Breeding pairs were recorded in the Santa Ynez River just downstream from Buellton until 2012, but more recently only solitary individuals have been seen (Lehman 2022). Dense riparian along the river channel offsite may be suitable for breeding and individuals could use riparian habitat along the margins of the property periodically, but onsite areas are not sufficiently dense or close enough to aquatic sites to support breeding. Extensive surveys occurred for this species during the development of River View Park and did not locate nesting pairs on that site. 
American Badger (Taxidea taxus) This species is a CDFW Species of Special Concern that occurs in grasslands, fields, scrubland edges, and woodland habitats. They excavate dens in dry, friable soils and feed on a variety of small mammals. There are several records of this species near the site but all are from at least 30 years ago (CDFW 2023a). Suitable habitat remains throughout the area, and individuals could move through the Santa Ynez River corridor and onto the study area periodically. There is a chance that they could forage or den onsite but the probability is low due to the lack of a significant prey base and degree of human activity surrounding the other three sides of the site. 
Pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) This species is a CDFW Species of Special Concern that occurs in a variety of arid habitats throughout the state. They roost in rock outcrops, caves, crevasses, mines hollow trees and buildings. This species was recorded along the Santa Ynez River near the site (CDFW 2022a).  They could fly over the site while foraging, and potentially could roost in outbuildings or large trees with cavities in the study area. 
Townsend's big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii) This species is a CDFW Species of Special Concern that prefers mesic habitats although also is found in dry scrubland. Roosting is in rocky cliffs with crevasses, and they also use mines, tunnels, abandoned buildings and bridges. Individuals and roost sites have been recorded near the study area (CDFW 2022a). They could fly over the site while foraging and potentially could roost in outbuildings. 
Designated Critical Habitat. No federally-designated critical habitat is present on the property. Designated critical habitat for the southern California Distinct Population Segment (DPS) steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus; pop. 10) is present within the Santa Ynez River but 
City of Buellton 
38 
does not occur within the study area (Figure 7). The limits of critical habitat are confined to the river channel below the Ordinary High Water Mark. Southwestern willow flycatcher critical habitat is also present along the river corridor adjacent to the site, but does not extend onto the site. Furthermore, the site does not contain the necessary habitat elements to support breeding habitat by this species. Designated critical habitat for the California red-legged frog is within five miles of the site but does not include the study area. 
Protected Nesting Birds. In addition to the special-status bird species listed above, species protected under the MBTA and/or California Department of Fish and Game Code could nest in the riparian, developed, ornamental or grassland habitats onsite.  
Sensitive Natural Communities and Riparian Habitats. The riparian habitat along the Santa Ynez River would be considered a CDFW sensitive natural community. Along the active channels is more well-developed forested habitat that can be classified as Southern Cottonwood-Willow Riparian Forest (State Rarity Rank S3.2). Further away from the active channels, the forested habitat segues into a more scrub like plant community, and this habitat is what extends onto the southwestern part of the property. The riparian habitat onsite would be classified as Southern Willow Scrub (State Rarity Rank S2.1). Both of these habitats are mapped in the CNDDB along the river, and field observations confirmed their presence (Figure 7). These communities meet the threshold under CEQA and would be considered a protected resource by the City under General Plan policies. The riparian area along the river that extends onto the property is expected to fall under the jurisdiction of the RWQCB under the Clean Water Act Section 401 and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, and CDFW under California Fish and Game Code Section 1602. It is not expected to meet the federal definition of a wetland or non-wetland waters of the U.S. The small swath of riparian habitat to the north of the wastewater treatment plant may also be a protected community given its proximity to an outfall structure and historic drainage feature. The riparian habitat in the old basin in the southern corner of the site has colonized this constructed feature, and is invaded by various non-native species. The basin was likely constructed during the dairy operations onsite, and is disjunct from river and does not appear to meet the criteria as a federally protected feature under the Clean Water Act. It is likely that CDFW and RWQCB would claim jurisdiction over the feature given the presence of riparian habitat in the river floodplain. The planted sycamore trees on the River View Park property would not be jurisdictional or a sensitive natural community since they were planted and are maintained as a component of the park. 
The CNDDB maps Southern California Steelhead Stream as a sensitive natural community along the Santa Ynez River. The CNDDB groups this designation with sensitive plant communities although it is a wildlife habitat. The limits of steelhead habitat are confined to the active channels of the river and do not occur onsite. 
Wetlands and Drainages.  A small patch of wetland habitat was observed at the outfall structure in the north corner of the study area. Based on the presence of rushes and cattails, at least two of the three wetland criteria (i.e., dominance of hydrophytes and positive indicators of wetland hydrology) are present on the subject property. The sandy and fine sandy loam soils do not appear to support ponding or prolonged soil saturation sufficient to establish hydric soils. No clay hardpan is present in this area that could support vernal pools. The basin in the southern part of the site was apparently constructed by past farming operations, and did not contain evidence of supporting any ponded water, even after the above average rain season experienced in 2022-2023.  
City of Buellton

The proposed access to the new parking lot would cross this small ephemeral drainage constructed on the River View Park property. Access would also utilize an existing dirt road crossing in the northwest part of the site. While a formal jurisdictional delineation has not been conducted, the ephemeral swale or stream feature was constructed during park development, and based on historic aerial photograph review, this area did not support any established riparian or wetland vegetation. Recent field work confirmed the area is maintained as part of the park and did not support any true riparian vegetation beyond the landscape plantings associated with the park. A small patch of emergent marsh wetland habitat was present at the outfall where the culvert daylights from under residential development, just offsite (Figure 4). The USGS topographic quadrangle and NWI do not show a drainage in this location, and the marshy vegetation area did not contain any surface water deeper than four inches during the surveys (Figures 2 and 4). The vegetation is confined to the outfall and is being supported by nuisance drainage from the residential development. It is not known if other roadway drainage and storm drain infrastructure add to the hydrology at this location, but no significant nexus or clearly defined drainage channel was present connecting this feature to the active channels of the Santa Ynez River. Given current regulatory guidance (Sackett v. EPA, 2023), it is unlikely that this ephemeral drainage or small patch of wetland vegetation at the outfall structure would be regulated under the Clean Water Act as a waters of the United States. The RWQCB and CDFW could potentially claim jurisdiction over this ephemeral stream and associated wetland habitat along with the riparian habitat mapped on Figure 4 . While riparian habitat in the south and east parts of the study area will be avoided, consultation with RWQCB and CDFW will be required to determine the jurisdictional status of this ephemeral stream/drainage feature originating from the culvert in the north. 
A constructed ditch also runs offsite along the eastern property boundary. It originates from a culvert outfall under residential development and is vegetated by upland non-native grassland species. The ditch appears to be regularly mowed. The ditch is not shown on the USGS topographic quadrangle or NWI, nor does it have a defined drainage upstream from urban development. It was probably constructed to divert stormwater from urban development around the wastewater treatment plant. Therefore, it is not expected to be jurisdictional, and current project plans do not show any impacts on this feature. 
Impact Analysis 
a. The following discussion relates to impacts to candidate, sensitive, or special status species identified in applicable regulations or by the California Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Special-Status Plants. No special-status plant species were determined to have potential to occur onsite; thus, no special-status plant species would be directly impacted by the project. There is no suitable habitat in adjacent areas that could support special-status plant species and there would be no indirect effects from project activities.  Therefore, there would be no impact of the project on special-status plant species and no additional surveys or mitigation is needed. 
Special-Status Animals. The project involves the construction of sports fields, parking areas, an access road, and associated facilities such as restrooms. The various elements of the 
City of Buellton 
40 
project are expected to be constructed during different phases, and the time of year when construction would begin has not been specified. Vegetation removal and ground disturbance could directly affect individuals of special-status animal species should they be onsite during construction, such as nesting birds. The project will not remove riparian habitat and will buffer the Santa Ynez River corridor with any significant development features such as buildings or parking lots. Improvements to the outbuildings and tree removal could also potentially affect roosting bats. These direct impacts are expected to be temporary and limited to the time that construction takes place. It is expected that construction would occur during the dry season when aquatic species such as the California red-legged frog and southwestern pond turtle are typically restricted to aquatic sites. Individuals of the following species could possibly be directly impacted by project construction: California red-legged frog (if construction occurs in winter rain season), northern California legless lizard, southwestern pond turtle (if construction occurs in winter rain season), American badger, pallid bat, Townsend's big-eared bat and nesting birds. Although this investigation determined that no suitable nesting habitat is present within the project area for least Bell's vireo or southwestern willow flycatcher, the City's General Plan requires that surveys for these species be conducted for any development located within 500 feet of the Santa Ynez River. Mitigation is described below for the animal species that may be directly affected by project construction to bring the level of effects to less than significant. 
Permanent impacts of habitat loss are expected to be less than significant because the project impact area (largely Developed/Ruderal and disturbed Non-native Grassland aka historic hay field) does not contain any significant natural resources that could support populations of these species.  Therefore, no mitigation is required for habitat loss.  
Minor effects could occur on bird and bat species that use the site for foraging such as a temporary disruption of activities, but foraging would resume after each phase is constructed.  California red-legged frogs and southwestern pond turtles could access upland areas of the site for movement and dispersal during wet periods, but are not expected to use the non-native grassland or disturbed areas for upland refuge due to lack of cover. Adverse effects on movement and dispersal would be temporary as these species could continue to use the area after the playing fields have been built. The lower portion of the site has been farmed in the past and construction of the play fields would not substantially change these characteristics. Additionally, riparian habitat along the river or south side of the property, which has higher habitat values, would not be affected. Temporary effects on transient wildlife use of the project area during construction would be less than significant. 
Increased human activity from the future on-going use of the site would generate noise, increased vehicle trips, trash, potential pesticide use, night lighting, trespass into the river corridor, and other disturbance. These activities could indirectly affect wildlife use of adjacent areas, including disrupting foraging, nesting, roosting and denning behavior. Similar to River View Park, fencing, signage and other methods would be used to buffer human activities from the river habitats. Given surrounding land uses, the effects of on-going increased human activity are expected to be less than significant. 
No designated critical habitat would be directly affected, and construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) would be implemented during site development to ensure runoff from disturbed areas does not enter the river corridor and indirectly affect steelhead critical habitat.  Mitigation measures to be implemented during construction are required to reduce indirect effects. Project effects on southern California steelhead DPS critical habitat are less than 
City of Buellton 
41 
significant with mitigation. The riparian habitat along the western edge of the study area is outside of the project impact area; therefore, there would be no effect on southwestern willow flycatcher critical habitat. 
Protected Nesting Birds. Construction activities during the avian breeding season (February 1 to August 31) could interrupt nesting behavior, leading to the abandonment of nests containing eggs or young, causing their mortality. Direct effects on protected nesting birds may occur during tree removal, such as for the possible expansion of the Children's Museum play area or construction of the access road, or for construction of the play fields on species that nest in grassland habitats. Birds could also nest in the riparian and ornamental habitats onsite in close enough proximity to construction noise that their behavior may be disrupted. In addition to the special-status bird species with potential to occur in the area, nesting activities of common species of birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and California Fish and Game Code could be affected by the project. Impacts on nesting birds are considered less than significant with mitigation. 
b. The following discussion relates to impacts to riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Sensitive Natural Communities and Riparian Habitats. The proposed Children’s Museum play area is adjacent to and possibly within Southern Willow Scrub riparian habitat along the slope adjacent to the existing developed area. This habitat may be a CDFW sensitive natural community and is considered a sensitive biological resource by the City. While the riparian habitat along the river is outside of the disturbance footprint, the small patches of riparian habitat elsewhere on the site should be avoided by project activities. The City requires a 200-foot setback from the bank of the Santa Ynez River, and if public or private development encroaches into the setback, riparian vegetation shall be replaced or restored or a mitigation fee shall be paid. Project impacts on sensitive natural communities and riparian habitats would be considered less than significant with mitigation. 
c. The following discussion relates to impacts to federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
State or Federally Protected Wetlands. Construction of the access driveway from River View Park would cross an ephemeral drainage using an existing dirt road crossing as well as a new improved road crossing. This drainage feature identified as an ephemeral stream on Figure 4 was constructed, during development of River View Park. It now has periodic flow from surrounding urban runoff. Installation of a new culvert and associated rock slope protection would likely require permitting from the RWQCB and CDFW, and these agencies will be consulted during project planning to evaluate the extent of their jurisdiction over the feature. Further evaluation of this feature would be needed during the development of final construction plans to determine the extent of disturbance and associated mitigation required. If the drainage feature s is impacted, permitting from the agencies may be needed. As previously stated, based on current regulatory guidance, it appears that the area would not be subject to the USACE pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act. To support permitting a delineation of jurisdictional areas (aka a wetland delineation) would be required. As a condition of any permit issued by state or federal regulatory agencies, compensatory mitigation may also be required 
City of Buellton 
42 
under the preparation of a Compensatory Mitigation and Monitoring Plan. If these measures are followed, project impacts on state protected wetlands or other jurisdictional areas would be considered less than significant with mitigation. 
d. The following discussion relates to impacts regarding wildlife movement or effects on migratory wildlife corridors. 
Movement of Fish or Wildlife, Wildlife Corridors or Nursery Site Impacts. No suitable aquatic habitat for native fish is present in the project area, and there would be no indirect effects on offsite areas. The project site is disturbed from many years of farming and more recent urban development, and the area would not be used as a wildlife corridor. As such, construction and operation of the project would not affect wildlife movement through the adjacent Santa Ynez River corridor. With the exception of birds and several other species (mitigation is described below), the project site is not expected to support breeding populations of any wildlife. Riparian and ornamental habitats on the property are mainly outside of the project footprint, and any trees removed would be replaced as described below. There would be no effect of the project on the movement of fish or wildlife, wildlife corridors or nursery sites. 
e. The following discusses the project’s consistency with local plans and ordinances that relate to biological resources. 
Local Policies and Ordinances. Phase 1 will not result in site disturbance that would impact existing protected trees. During Phase 2, some planted ornamentals as well as planted sycamores along the ephemeral stream may require removal during road construction. Native and non-native tree species with a trunk diameter at breast height of 8 inches or more are considered to be protected by the City under the General Plan and native tree species under The Native Tree Protection Ordinance (Chapter 12.32 of the Buellton Municipal Code). While protected native trees that are removed require authorization by the City along with payment of an applicable permit fee under the Native Tree Protection Ordinance, activities undertaken by the City are exempt. However, it is expected that the City would follow its native tree replacement standards. A 200-foot setback from the Santa Ynez River is required for public or private development and tree replacement planting opportunities exist along the southwestern part of the property. One proposed playing field is at least 600 feet from the current low-flow channel and approximately 50 feet from the berm that delineates the river floodplain. All structures are to be situated over 200 feet from the river corridor. Any conflicts with local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources are considered less than significant with mitigation. 
e. and f. The following discusses the project’s consistency with any relevant conservation plans, including Habitat Conservation Plans. 
Conservation Plan Conflicts. No Habitat Conservation Plans, Natural Community Conservation Plans or other local, regional, or state conservation plans have been prepared for the area in which the project is located. Therefore, there would be no conflict with any type of conservation plan. 
Mitigation Measures 
In order to reduce impacts on biological resources to less than significant levels, the following mitigation measures shall be implemented: 
City of Buellton 
43 
Mitigation Measure BIO-1. Preconstruction Survey (Special-Status Species). 
Conduct a preconstruction survey for special-status wildlife and implement avoidance and protection measures during construction.  Within seven days prior to the start of vegetation removal or grading for any phase of the project, a qualified biologist approved by the City shall survey permanent and temporary impact areas to ensure the species listed above are not present.  The biologist shall survey the site under suitable environmental conditions using appropriate protocols to detect the target species. Additional detail for focused surveys is provided, as follows. 
Least Bell’s Vireo, Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, California Red-Legged Frog. Consistent with General Plan policies, because the site is located within 500 feet of the Santa Ynez River, surveys shall be conducted to determine the presence or absence of state and/or federally listed species, including least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, and California red-legged frog. If any individuals of federally listed species are found during the surveys, consultation with the USFWS and/or state may be required.   
American Badger. The qualified biologist shall survey the project impact area including the access road plus a 250-foot buffer for potential American badger dens.  Any potential badger dens/burrows found that appear active shall be identified with flagging or stakes, and a 200-foot no-work buffer shall be flagged.  All foot and vehicle traffic, construction activities, and storage of supplies and equipment, shall remain outside of buffer areas.  Buffer areas shall be maintained until all project-related disturbances have been terminated.  If any burrows and their appropriate buffer areas cannot be avoided during all work activities, then the qualified biologist shall determine whether they are active by installing wildlife trail cameras and/or tracking medium and monitoring them daily for at least three days.  If the work takes place in the late-spring or summer, additional measures shall be employed to determine whether dens are occupied by badger young.  No dens with young shall be disturbed, and no work shall be conducted within 200 feet of maternal dens until the young have left the den.  If any active burrow occupied by a single adult badger is found and a 50-foot buffer area cannot be avoided, then the den shall be closed incrementally by placing sticks and debris over the entrance for three to five days, to discourage the animal from using the den.  Only after the badger has left the den, as determined by the qualified biologist implementing the wildlife camera and/or tracking medium methods, can the den be excavated and work proceed.  Destruction of a burrow is typically done by incrementally excavating it until it is confirmed that no animals are occupying the burrow.  Excavation using hand tools is the recommended method for destroying a burrow.  Use of excavating equipment can be done with extreme caution and while being monitored by a qualified biologist.  After the burrow is destroyed, the excavation shall be filled with dirt and compacted to make sure that burrowing animals cannot re-enter or use the burrow during construction.  If an American badger is discovered inside the burrow during excavation, activities should cease immediately and the animal allowed to leave under its own volition.  Burrow destruction may proceed once it is determined that the animal has left the den. 
Bat Species. Potential bat roost sites (trees with cavities, outbuildings) that will be disturbed by construction activities shall be inspected for sign of roosting bats such as guano or prey remains.  Emergence or re-entry surveys should be conducted for those sites with evidence of bat occupancy. The qualified biologist shall determine whether a 
City of Buellton 
44 
maternity roost is present by carefully observing individuals on the roost.  If young are present, no work shall occur within 100 feet of the roost location of any bat species until the young can fly on their own. If any non-maternal bat roosts are found, and the work is being conducted outside of the winter hibernation period, the biologist shall coordinate with the City and CDFW on methods to ensure the successful relocation of individuals to suitable habitat nearby.  In some cases, CDFW may recommend creating structures for displaced bats.  Bats can be restricted from roost sites by placing netting over their entrances after they have left the roost for night-time foraging. Only after the roosting bats have left the site can the tree/structure be disturbed. 
The biologist shall submit a report to the City detailing the methods and results of the preconstruction surveys. The report should detail the number and location of any special-status animal species found and measures implemented for avoidance prior to the start of construction.  Observations of special-status species shall be submitted to the CNDDB. 
Mitigation Measure BIO-2. Construction Timing. Conduct the initiation of construction activities outside of the nesting season. All initial site disturbance shall be limited to the time period between September 1 and January 31, if feasible. If initial site disturbance such as vegetation/tree removal, grading, and improvements to outbuildings cannot be conducted during this time period, implementation of Mitigation Measure BIO­3 is required. 
Mitigation Measure BIO-3. Preconstruction Nesting Bird Survey. Conduct a preconstruction nesting bird survey for each phase of the project. If it is not possible to schedule the initiation of construction between September 1 and January 31, a qualified biologist shall conduct a preconstruction survey for nesting birds within 500 feet of project impact areas to ensure that no active nests will be disturbed. The pre-construction survey shall be conducted no more than seven days before the initiation of construction activities in any given area of the project site. During this survey, the qualified biologist shall inspect all potential nest substrates within 500 feet from the impact area, and any nests identified will be monitored to determine if they are active. If no active nests are found, construction may proceed. If an active nest is found within 50 feet (250 feet for raptors) of the construction area, the biologist, in consultation with the CDFW, shall determine the extent of a buffer to be established around the nest. No work shall take place within the buffer area until the young have left the nest, as determined by a qualified biologist. 
Mitigation Measure BIO-4. Wildlife Exclusion Fence. Erect wildlife exclusion fence along the river corridor prior to and during ground disturbing work to install the play fields and monitor during construction.  To prevent California red-legged frogs and southwestern pond turtles from accessing the site, and deter American badgers from denning onsite, a wildlife exclusion fence (i.e., ERTEC Triple-function E-fence or similar) shall be installed along the southwestern, southern and western sides of the project site by the end of April during the season prior to breaking ground.  The bottom edge of the fence shall be trenched into the ground to a depth of at least 6 inches, and the soil recompacted along either side.  The fence shall be surveyed by a qualified monitor prior to the start of work each day for southwestern pond turtles or California red-legged frogs that may have entered the work area or are disoriented on the outside of the fence.  The biological monitor shall also inspect the integrity of the fence and ensure that it 
City of Buellton 
45 
remains functioning until ground disturbance has been completed.  If any southwestern pond turtles or California red-legged frogs are found within the work area, CDFW or USFWS, respectively, shall be contacted to receive authorization to move them to suitable habitat away from project impacts.  Work shall be halted within 50 feet of the individual until the agencies have provided authorization to proceed. 
Mitigation Measure BIO-5. Preliminary Jurisdictional Waters Delineation. Since site access improvements require a new road crossing of the ephemeral drainage feature to be constructed in Phase 2, a Preliminary Delineation of Waters of the United States and State of California (aka wetland delineation) shall be conducted within 100 feet of all proposed limits of disturbance affecting the ephemeral stream.  The jurisdictional areas and any required setbacks shall be provided to project engineers to be shown on all project plans.  The delineation should also include a consultation component to review the project and drainage feature with state agencies to determine if permitting from the RWQCB and CDFW will be needed .  As discussed above, it appears there are no federal wetlands or drainage features onsite under the jurisdiction of the USACE, but the wetland delineation should evaluate onsite features consistent with current regulatory guidance.  The wetland delineation shall be submitted to the agencies in support of the permit applications.  Any riparian habitat lost or encroachment of development within the setback area shall be replaced onsite at a minimum 1:1 ratio.  Note that the agencies may require a higher ratio of up to 3:1 in some instances.  Impacts within 50-foot creek or 200-foot river setback areas would also require riparian habitat restoration under the General Plan. These activities shall be conducted under a Compensatory Mitigation and Monitoring Plan (CMMP) prepared by a qualified biologist, and submitted to the agencies and City for approval.  The CMMP shall follow guidelines established by the state and federal agencies and be implemented under the direction of a qualified biologist and monitored for at least five years to ensure that success criteria are met. 
Mitigation Measure BIO-6. Tree Inventory. Since site access improvements would require a new road crossing of the ephemeral drainage feature in Phase 2 , a a tree inventory shall be conducted prior to construction activities to map all trees at least 8 inches in diameter at breast height (dbh) within 50 feet of all potential limits of site disturbance.  The inventory shall mark the location of each native tree using a Global Positioning System with submeter accuracy and then shown on project construction and/or improvement plans.  Each tree shall be assigned a unique number and marked in the field by an aluminum tag.  Data collected for each tree shall include species, number of trunks at least 8 inches dbh, and a relative vigor rating.  If any non-native trees with a trunk diameter of at least 8 inches dbh are removed, they shall be replaced at a ratio of at least two new trees for every tree removed (2:1 ratio).  Native tree species, including oaks, at least 8 inches dbh shall be replaced at a minimum 5:1 ratio under the General Plan. Municipal Code 12.32.070 specifies ratios of 3:1 for oak trees, and 2:1 for cottonwood and sycamore trees.  Compensatory planting for both non-native and native trees removed shall be native species on the City's approved tree planting list and obtained from locally sourced stock.  Mitigation shall be done under the CMMP prepared and implemented by a qualified biologist.  In accordance with the Native Tree Protection Ordinance, replacement trees shall be established in locations suitable for their growth and survival, as determined by a qualified biologist/arborist, no closer than twenty (20) feet from each other or from existing oak trees and no farther than one hundred sixty-five 
City of Buellton 
46 
(165)to one hundred eighty (180) feet from each other or existing oak trees unless otherwise approved by the arborist.  Herbivore protection fencing is required until the trees reach a minimum of eight (8) feet in height.  The mitigation site shall be maintained and monitored for at least five (5) years. 
Mitigation Measure BIO-7. Worker Environmental Awareness Program. Prepare and present a Worker Environmental Awareness Program. A qualified biologist shall prepare a Worker Environmental Awareness Program that will be presented to all construction personnel and employees before any ground-disturbing activities commence at the project site. This program shall detail the measures undertaken during project implementation to avoid and minimize impacts on biological resources. It shall include a description of the status of protected species and resources that may be present in the area and the measures to be undertaken during the project to avoid impacts on these resources. All attendees of the Worker Environmental Awareness Program shall sign an attendance form. 
Mitigation Measure BIO-8. Erosion and Sediment Controls. Install appropriate erosion and sediment controls during construction.  The following erosion and sedimentation control Best Management Practices (BMPs) are required to be implemented during each of the ground disturbing phases of the project: 
a.  If possible, the potential for erosion and sedimentation shall be minimized by  
scheduling construction to occur outside of the rainy season (typically October 15  
through April 15).  
b.  To minimize site disturbance, all construction related equipment shall be restricted to  
established roads, construction areas, and other designated staging areas.  
c.  A Sediment and Erosion Control Plan may be required by the City, and shall be  
prepared by a qualified engineer.  The use of silt fence, straw wattles, erosion control  
blankets, straw bales, sandbags, fiber rolls and other appropriate techniques should be  
employed to protect the drainage features on and off the property.  Biotechnical  
approaches using native vegetation shall be used as feasible. All areas with soil  
disturbance shall have appropriate erosion controls and other stormwater protection  
BMPs installed per the engineer’s requirements, and in place prior to October 15.   
Methods that are not biodegradable should be removed after vegetation has become  
established and following the end of the rainy season (late-spring or summer).  
d.  Spill kits shall be maintained on the site, and a Spill Response Plan shall be in place.  
e.  No vehicles or equipment shall be refueled within 100 feet of drainage features unless  
a bermed and lined refueling area is constructed.  No vehicles or construction  
equipment shall be stored overnight within 100 feet of these areas unless drip pans or  
ground covers are used.  All equipment and vehicles should be checked and  
maintained on a daily basis to ensure proper operation and to avoid potential leaks or  
spills.  Construction staging areas should attain zero discharge of stormwater runoff  
into these habitats.  
f.  No concrete washout shall be conducted on the site outside of an appropriate  
containment system.  Washing of equipment, tools, etc. should not be allowed in any  
location where the tainted water could enter onsite drainages.  
g.  The use of chemicals, fuels, lubricants, or biocides shall be in compliance with all  
local, state, and federal regulations.  All uses of such compounds shall observe label  
and other restrictions mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,  

City of Buellton 
47 
California Department of Food and Agriculture, and other state and federal legislation. 
h. 
All project-related spills of hazardous materials within or adjacent to the project site should be cleaned up immediately. 

i. 
Areas with disturbed soils shall be restored under the direction of the project engineer in consultation with a qualified restoration ecologist as needed.  Methods may include recontouring graded areas to blend in with existing natural contours, covering the areas with salvaged topsoil containing native seedbank from the site, and/or applying the native seed mix shown on the project plans supplemented with species in Table 3.  Native seed mix shall be applied to the graded areas through either direct hand seeding or hydroseeding methods.  Seeding with the erosion control native seed mix should be provided on all disturbed soil areas prior to the onset of the rainy season (by October 15).  Compost, fiber and tackifier may also be incorporated.

Findings and Mitigation: Mitigation Measures BIO-1 through BIO-8 as described above would be required to address potential impacts related to biological resources to a less than significant level. 
ISSUES:  Potentially Significant Impact  Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated  Less Than Significant Impact  No Impact  
V. CULTURAL RESOURCES -Would the project:  
a) Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in § 15064.5?  X  
b) Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to § 15064.5?  X  
d) Disturb any human remains, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries?  X  

a. There is an existing barn structure on the site, which is intended for adaptation and future use as part of the project. The barn was named a historical landmark by the City Council in September 2020. The requirement in place as a result of this designation is that “that any proposed alteration, addition, or demolition, to the site or any structure thereon is (prior to the issuance of any entitlement, building permit, demolition permit, or grading permit which may alter the existing site or buildings) subject to City Council review of appropriate mitigation of 
loss to a historic resource through permanent acknowledgement and recognition of the site’s historical significance.” This requirement will be included as a mitigation measure in this document to address any potential impacts to that structure. The City Council will evaluate this impact determine whether this proposed mitigation measure is appropriate mitigation to reduce potential impacts to a less than significant level. 
City of Buellton 
48 
b. and c. No known artifacts have been found on this site. Any artifacts located on this property would have likely been removed or destroyed through past flood events, as part of the site is within the 100-year flood zone of the Santa Ynez River. Therefore the potential for future discoveries is extremely unlikely. In the unlikely event that previously unidentified cultural resources are encountered during site grading activities, state laws related to the protection of cultural resources would apply. To provide additional protection against possible impacts to unknown cultural resources, the following Mitigation Measure CR-1 is required. 
Mitigation Measure 
CR-1: Halt Work Order for Archaeological Resources. If unanticipated cultural resources are exposed during construction of a Project, all earth disturbing work within the vicinity of the find must be temporarily suspended until an archaeologist has evaluated the nature and significance of the find. After the find has been appropriately mitigated, work in the area may resume. A representative should monitor any mitigation excavation associated with the Native American materials. 
Monitoring. Upon notification by project developer of discovery of a potential find, Planning Department will verify that archaeologists and Native American representatives have been contacted to evaluate the materials found and, if necessary to monitor any consequent mitigation activities. 
d. Since no known cemetery uses or prehistoric burial sites are located on or adjacent to the site, the proposed project would result in no impacts to known human remains. If human remains are discovered, CEQA guidelines 15064.5 (e), Health and Safety Code sections 7050.5 and 5097.98 contain protocols that must be followed, as well as Mitigation Measure CR-1. 
Findings and Mitigation: Potential impacts are considered less than significant with the incorporation of required Mitigation Measure CR-1.

VI. ENERGY -Would the project:  
a) Result in potentially significant environmental impact due to wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy resources, during project construction or operation?  X  
b) Conflict with or obstruct a state or local plan for renewable energy or energy efficiency?  X  

Impact Analysis 
a. Project Construction. Project construction would require temporary energy resources primarily in the form of fuel consumption to operate heavy equipment, light-duty vehicles, machinery, and generators. Temporary grid power may also be provided to construction trailers or electric construction equipment. Energy use during construction activities would be temporary, and construction equipment used would be typical of similar-sized construction projects in the region. In addition, construction contractors are required to comply with the provisions of 13 California Code of Regulations Sections 2449 and 2485, which prohibit diesel-
City of Buellton 
49 
fueled commercial motor vehicles and off-road diesel vehicles from idling for more than five minutes, minimizing unnecessary fuel consumption. Construction equipment would be subject to the U.S. EPA Construction Equipment Fuel Efficiency Standard (40 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 1039, 1065, and 1068), which minimizes inefficient fuel consumption. Electrical power would be consumed during construction activities, and the demand would be supplied from existing electrical infrastructure in the area. Electricity used for construction purposes would be minor and limited to intermittent use of construction equipment. 
Overall, temporary project construction activities would utilize fuel-and energy-efficient equipment consistent with the most recently adopted state and federal regulations and would comply with state measures to reduce the inefficient, wasteful, or unnecessary consumption of energy. Construction contractors would not be anticipated to utilize fuel or electricity in a manner that is wasteful or unnecessary as a business practice to ensure cost efficiency. Therefore, project construction would not result in potentially significant environmental effects due to the wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy. 
Project Operation. Energy demand from long-term operation of new development on the project site would include electricity consumed by non-residential buildings and energy associated with fuel consumption. Energy consumption will be very minor and sporadic, as most activities on the site will involve be passive use of outdoor sports fields and play area. Occasional events such as weddings would use energy in the form of lighting and heating, but these events would be infrequent in nature. It is highly likely that the overall energy use per square foot would be much lower than permanently occupied buildings such as residences, commercial uses or office space. Therefore, the project operation would not result in significant impacts due to the wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy. As a result, this impact would be less than significant. 
b. The following describe key regulations that relate to the project’s energy use, and the extent 
that the project will be consistent with these requirements. 
California Energy Plan. The California Energy Commission (CEC) is responsible for preparing the California Energy Plan, which identifies emerging trends related to energy supply, demand, conservation, public health and safety, and the maintenance of a healthy economy. The 2008 California Energy Plan calls for the state to assist in the transformation of the transportation system to improve air quality, reduce congestion, and increase the efficient use of fuel supplies with the least environmental and energy costs. To further this policy, the plan identifies several strategies, including assistance to public agencies and fleet operators in implementing incentive programs for zero-emission vehicles and addressing their infrastructure needs, as well as encouragement of urban designs that reduce vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and accommodate pedestrian and bicycle access. 
Building Energy Efficiency Standards. The California Building Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings (California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 6) were adopted to ensure that building construction and system design and installation achieve energy efficiency and preserve outdoor and indoor environmental quality. The current California Building Energy Efficiency Standards (Title 24 standards) are the 2019 Title 24 standards, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The 2019 Title 24 standards include efficiency improvements to the lighting and efficiency improvements to the non-residential 
City of Buellton 
50 
standards include alignment with the American Society of Heating and Air-Conditioning Engineers. As a result, potential impacts would be less than significant.

VII. GEOLOGY AND SOILS -Would the project:  
a) Expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of loss, injury, or death involving: i) Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or based on other substantial evidence of a known fault?  X  
ii) Strong seismic ground shaking?  X  
iii) Inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow?  X  
iv) Landslides?  X  
b) Result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil?  X  
c) Be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of the project, and potentially result in on-or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction or collapse?  X  
d) Be located on expansive soil creating substantial risks to life or property?  X  
e) Have soils incapable of adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems where sewers are not available for the disposal of wastewater?  X  
f) Directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological resource or site or unique geologic feature?  X  

The following analysis of geological resources is based on the City’s General Plan Safety Element Plan and previous geotechnical studies conducted in the City and on the project site, which are on file at the Buellton Planning Department. 
a.  Geologic Hazards: 
Fault Rupture: There are no known active fault lines within the City. No impacts would occur. 
Groundshaking: The San Andreas Fault, located approximately 74 kilometers east of Buellton, dominates both the geologic structure and seismicity of the project area. However, faults closer to the project site also have the potential to generate earthquakes and strong groundshaking at the site. These include: (1) the offshore group, including the Hosgri and Santa Lucia (Purisima and Lompoc) faults; and (2) the Santa Ynez Fault. In addition, the Los Alamos-Baseline-Lions and Casmalia-Orcutt-Little Pine faults may be active and pose potential to generate groundshaking at the project site. 
The largest upper level earthquake (ULE) in Buellton would be an approximate 7.8 moment magnitude earthquake on the San Andreas Fault. Such an event could produce peak horizontal ground acceleration on the order of 0.16g1. Due to the relative location of the Los Alamos-
The force on a building during an earthquake is proportional to ground acceleration. Such forces are prescribed by the UBC. During an earthquake the ground acceleration varies with time. “g” is a common value of acceleration equal to9.8 m/sec/sec (the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the earth). 30% of g is the acceleration one would experience in a car that takes 9 seconds to brake from 60 miles per 
City of Buellton 
52 
Baseline (approximately 8 kilometers south), Santa Ynez (approximately 10 kilometers northeast), and North Channel Slope (approximately 25 kilometers east) faults to Buellton, higher ULE accelerations may be expected from these faults. Although higher accelerations may be experienced in Buellton from these faults, compared to events on the San Andreas Fault, the recurrence interval for such events is much longer than for an event on the active San Andreas Fault Zone. Seismic safety issues would be addressed through the California Building Code and implementation of the recommendations on foundation and structural design contained in the geotechnical investigation. Less than significant impacts would result. 
Seismic Ground Failure: Liquefaction is the phenomenon in which soil temporarily loses strength due to a buildup of excess pore-water pressure caused by seismic shaking. The primary factors influencing liquefaction potential include depth of groundwater, soil type, relative density of sandy soils, overburden pressure, fines content and the intensity and duration of ground shaking. Liquefaction potential is greatest in saturated, loose, poorly graded fine sands with grain size (D50) in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 millimeters. Per the geotechnical study, the potential for liquefaction is low (GeoSolutions, Inc., 2016). 
General Plan Safety Element Policy S-1 requires that new development (habitable structures including commercial and industrial buildings) be set back at least 200 feet from the bank of the Santa Ynez River. The nearest inhabited structure would be setback more than 200 feet from the river. The project would be consistent with this policy in this respect, which will minimize liquefaction hazards. 
Policy S-7 requires that all new development shall satisfy the requirements of the California Building Code regarding seismic safety. Conformance with this policy would ensure that potential impacts related to liquefaction would be less than significant. 
Seiche, Tsunami, Mudflow: The site is not located in the vicinity of any body of water that could result in a seiche or tsunami, and the project site is relatively flat and is not located adjacent to any substantial slopes. No impacts would occur. 
Landsliding: Slopes in the City are geologically stable and are not subject to major landslides. The project site is on a generally level property. As such, no impacts would occur with respect to landsliding. 
b. Erosion: The project proposes grading to create a level building pad, above the 100-year floodplain limits, for the proposed structure and related improvements. Cutting and filling may 
result in increased erosion. The City’s adopted Grading Ordinance, requirements of the Regional Water Quality Control Board, and The City’s Standard Conditions of Approval require erosion 
and sediment control plans for all projects. Based on the required implementation of these requirements, the impact to erosion is considered less than significant. 
c., d. Unstable/Expansive Soils: While the site appears suitable from a geotechnical engineering standpoint, for the construction of the proposed project, a project-specific soils investigation would provide specific recommendations for project design and construction. These project design recommendations related to grading, building foundation, driveway and parking area construction, will be required as part of grading and building plan approval, and would ensure that the impacts are less than significant. 
hour to a complete stop.

e. Suitability for Septic Systems: All project wastewater would be discharged to the City sewer system.  No septic systems have been proposed.  No impacts would result. 
Findings and Mitigation: All development of the site must follow standard California Building Code requirements. Compliance with these regulations and requirements and the recommendations from a site-specific geotechnical soils investigation would result in less than significant geology related impacts. The Public Works Department/City Engineer will verify that the final project design incorporates any design recommendations from an approved project-specific geologic study prior to issuing grading permits.

VIII. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ­Would the project:  
a) Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the environment?  X  
b) Conflict with any applicable plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases?  X  

This section is based on a technical report prepared by Ambient analyzing greenhouse gas emissions as they relate to the project. This report is included as Appendix C to this Initial Study, and includes extensive background information and a regulatory framework that are summarized below. The major findings of the technical analysis are also included below, but for the full analysis, please refer to Appendix C. 
Setting 
Project implementation would generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the burning of fossil fuels or other emissions, thus potentially contributing to cumulative impacts related to global climate change. The following summarizes the regulatory framework related to climate change. 
There is an extensive federal, state and local regulatory basis for analyzing this issue, which is described in detail in the technical report included in Appendix C. These key regulations are listed and summarized below: 
Federal 
Executive Order 13514 Executive Order 13514 is focused on reducing GHGs internally in federal agency missions, programs, and operations. In addition, the executive order directs federal agencies to participate 
City of Buellton 
54 
in the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force, which is engaged in developing a national strategy for adaptation to climate change. 
State 
Assembly Bill 1493 AB 1493 (Pavley) of 2002 (Health and Safety Code Sections 42823 and 43018.5) required the 
ARB to develop and adopt the nation’s first GHG emission standards for automobiles. The 
California Legislature declared in AB 1493 that global warming is a matter of increasing concern for public health and the environment. It cites several risks that California faces from climate change, including a reduction in the state’s water supply; an increase in air pollution caused by higher temperatures; harm to agriculture; an increase in wildfires; damage to the coastline; and economic losses caused by higher food, water, energy, and insurance prices. 
Executive Order S-3-05 Executive Order S-3-05 (State of California) proclaims that California is vulnerable to the 
impacts of climate change. It declares that increased temperatures could reduce the Sierra’s snowpack, further exacerbate California’s air quality problems, and potentially cause a rise in sea 
levels. To combat those concerns, the Executive Order established total GHG emission targets. Specifically, emissions are to be reduced to the 2000 level by 2010, to the 1990 level by 2020, and to 80 percent below the 1990 level by 2050. 
Executive Order B-30-15 In 2015, Governor Brown signed Executive Order B-30-15, which establishes a California GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. 
Executive Order B-55-18 In 2018, Governor Brown signed Executive Order B-55-18, which set a target of statewide carbon neutrality by 2045. 
Executive Order N-79-20 In 2020, Governor Newsom signed Executive Order N-79-20, which calls for elimination of new internal combustion passenger vehicles by 2035. It would end sales of internal combustion passenger vehicles by 2035. It is important to note that the Executive Order focuses on new vehicle sales for automakers, and therefore does not require Californians to give up the existing cars and trucks they already own. 
Climate Change Scoping Plan In October 2008, ARB published its Climate Change Proposed Scoping Plan, which is the State’s plan to achieve GHG reductions in California required by AB 32. This initial Scoping Plan contained the main strategies to be implemented in order to achieve the target emission levels identified in AB 32. The Scoping Plan included ARB-recommended GHG reductions for each 
emissions sector of the state’s GHG inventory. 
Mandatory Reporting of GHG Emissions The California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32, 2006) requires the reporting of GHGs by major sources to the ARB. Major sources required to report GHG emissions include industrial facilities, suppliers of transportation fuels, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied petroleum 
City of Buellton 
55 
gas, and carbon dioxide, operators of petroleum and natural gas systems, and electricity retail providers and marketers. 
Senate Bill 97 SB 97 was enacted in 2007. SB 97 required the Office of Planning and Research to develop, and the Natural Resources Agency to adopt, amendments to the CEQA Guidelines addressing the analysis and mitigation of GHG emissions. Those CEQA Guidelines amendments clarified several points, including the following: 
. 
Lead agencies must analyze the GHG emissions of proposed projects and must reach a conclusion regarding the significance of those emissions. 

. 
When a project’s GHG emissions may be significant, lead agencies must consider a 


range of potential mitigation measures to reduce those emissions. 
. 
Lead agencies must analyze potentially significant impacts associated with placing projects in hazardous locations, including locations potentially affected by climate change. 

. 
Lead agencies may significantly streamline the analysis of GHGs on a project level by using a programmatic GHG emissions reduction plan meeting certain criteria. 

. 
CEQA mandates analysis of a proposed project’s potential energy use (including transportation-related energy), sources of energy supply and ways to reduce energy demand, including through the use of efficient transportation alternatives. 

. 
As part of the administrative rulemaking process, the California Natural Resources Agency developed a Final Statement of Reasons explaining the legal and factual bases, intent, and purpose of the CEQA Guidelines amendments. The amendments to the CEQA Guidelines implementing SB 97 became effective on March 18, 2010. 


Cap-and-Trade Regulation The cap-and-trade regulation is a key element in California’s climate plan. It sets a statewide limit on sources responsible for 85 percent of California’s GHG emissions and establishes a price signal needed to drive long-term investment in cleaner fuels and more efficient use of energy. The cap-and-trade rules came into effect on January 1, 2013, and apply to large electric power plants and large industrial plants. In 2015, fuel distributors, including distributors of heating and transportation fuels, also became subject to the cap-and-trade rules. At that stage, the program 
will encompass around 360 businesses throughout California and nearly 85 percent of the state’s total GHG emissions. California’s GHG cap-and-trade system is projected to achieve an approximate 80 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2050. 
Senate Bill 32 SB 32 was signed by Governor Brown on September 8, 2016. SB 32 effectively extends California’s GHG emission-reduction goals from year 2020 to year 2030. This new emission-reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 is intended to promote further GHG-
reductions in support of the State’s ultimate goal of reducing GHG emissions by 80 percent 
below 1990 levels by 2050. SB 32 also directs the ARB to update the Climate Change Scoping Plan to address this interim 2030 emission-reduction target. 
Senate Bill 100 SB 100 was signed by Governor Jerry Brown on September 10, 2018. SB 100 sets a goal of phasing out all fossil fuels from the state’s electricity sector by 2045. SB 100 increases to 60 percent, from 50 percent, how much of California’s electricity portfolio must come from 
renewables by 2030. It establishes a further goal to have an electric grid that is entirely powered 
City of Buellton 
56 
by clean energy by 2045, which could include other carbon-free sources, like nuclear power, that are not renewable. 
Senate Bill 375 SB 375 requires Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to adopt a sustainable communities strategy (SCS) or alternative planning strategy (APS) that will address land-use allocation in that MPOs regional transportation plan. ARB, in consultation with MPOs, establishes regional reduction targets for GHGs emitted by passenger cars and light trucks for the years 2020 and 2035. These reduction targets will be updated every eight years but can be updated every four years if advancements in emissions technologies affect the reduction strategies to achieve the targets. ARB is also charged with reviewing each MPO’s SCS or APS for consistency with its assigned targets. If MPOs do not meet the GHG reduction targets, funding for transportation projects may be withheld. In 2018, ARB adopted updated SB 375 targets. 
California Building Code The CBC contains standards that regulate the method of use, properties, performance, or types of materials used in the construction, alteration, improvement, repair, or rehabilitation of a building or other improvement to real property. The CBC is adopted every three years by the BSC. In the interim, the BSC also adopts annual updates to make necessary mid-term corrections. The CBC standards apply statewide; however, a local jurisdiction may amend a CBC standard if it makes a finding that the amendment is reasonably necessary due to local climatic, geological, or topographical conditions. 
Green Building Standards Green buildings standards are contained in the CBC and regulate the construction of new buildings and improvements. The focus of green building standards is to improve environmental performance. 
Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Strategy In March 2017, the ARB adopted the Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Strategy (SLCP Strategy) establishing a path to decrease GHG emissions and displace fossil-based natural gas use. Strategies include avoiding landfill methane emissions by reducing the disposal of organics through edible food recovery, composting, in-vessel digestion, and other processes; and recovering methane from wastewater treatment facilities, and manure methane at dairies, and using the methane as a renewable source of natural gas to fuel vehicles or generate electricity. The SLCP Strategy identifies measures that can reduce HFC emissions at national and international levels, in addition to State-level action that includes an incentive program to encourage the use of low-GWP refrigerants, and limitations on the use of high-GWP refrigerants in new refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment (ARB 2022). 
Local 
Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District The SBCAPCD is a local public agency with the primary mission of realizing and preserving clean air for all county residents and businesses. Responsibilities of the SBCAPCD include, but are not limited to, preparing plans for the attainment of ambient air quality standards, adopting and enforcing rules and regulations concerning sources of air pollution, issuing permits for stationary sources of air pollution, inspecting stationary sources of air pollution and responding 
City of Buellton 
57 
to citizen complaints, monitoring ambient air quality and meteorological conditions, and implementing programs and regulations required by federal and state regulatory requirements. 
City of Buellton The City of Buellton has not adopted a qualified greenhouse gas reduction plan pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15183.5(b)(1). Therefore, this analysis does not utilize the tiering and streamlining provisions of CEQA Guidelines Section 15183.5(b)(2) in evaluating the 
significance of the project’s impacts related to GHG emissions. 
Thresholds of Significance 
Neither the SBCAPCD nor the City of Buellton have adopted GHG thresholds of significance for development projects that are subject to CEQA. However, the County of Santa Barbara has recently developed an interim GHG emissions threshold of significance of 300 MTCO2e per year (Santa Barbara County 2020). Projects that exceed this screening threshold can also be 
evaluated based on an efficiency GHG emissions threshold based on the project’s estimated service population, if applicable. The County’s interim thresholds are based on SB 32 year 2030 GHG-reduction goals, which take into consideration the emission reduction strategies outlined in 
ARB’s Scoping Plan. Projects that do not exceed the County’s interim thresholds would be 
considered to have a less than significant increase in GHG emissions and would not be expected to interfere with GHG-reduction planning efforts (Santa Barbara County 2020). Given that development within both the County and the City would be subject to compliance with the 
State’s building standards, land use development projects and associated GHG emissions 
occurring within the City would be similar to that which would occur within the County. For this reason and for purposes of this analysis, project generated emissions were evaluated solely in comparison to a significance threshold of 300 MTCO2e per year. Project-generated GHG emissions that would exceed 300 MTCO2e/year would be considered to have a potentially significant impact on the environment that could conflict with GHG-reduction planning efforts. 
Methodology 
Short-term Construction Impacts Short-term emissions were quantified using the CalEEMod, version 2020.4.0, based on estimated acreages and building square footage for the proposed project. Other modeling assumptions, including construction equipment requirements, hours of use, worker, and vendor vehicle trips, trip distances, and fleet mix were based on model defaults for the County. Construction-generated GHG emissions were amortized over a 30-year period and included with estimated long-term operational GHG emissions for impact assessment purposes. 
Long-term Operational Air Quality Impacts Long-term operational GHG emissions were calculated using the CalEEMod, version 2020.4.0. Emissions modeling included quantification of emissions associated with area sources, energy use, and mobile sources. Trip-generation rates for the proposed land uses were derived from the traffic analysis prepared for this project (ATE 2023). Other modeling assumptions, such as vehicle fleet-mix, were not available and, therefore, were based on the default fleet mix identified in CalEEMod for Santa Barbara County. Annual emissions were adjusted based on a total of approximately 12 major events (e.g., weddings) per year (ATE 2023). Emission modeling files are provided in Appendix C to this Initial Study.

Impact Analysis 
a. and b. Estimated GHG emissions attributable to future development would be primarily associated with increases of CO2 from mobile sources. To a lesser extent, other GHG pollutants, such as CH4 and N2O, would also be generated. Short-term and long-term GHG emissions associated with the development of the proposed project are discussed in greater detail, as follows: 
Short-term Construction GHG Emissions Estimated increases in GHG emissions associated with the construction of the proposed project are summarized in Table 3. Based on the modeling conducted, construction-related GHG emissions would total approximately 222 MTCO2e. Amortized GHG emissions, when averaged over the conservative assumption of 30-year life of the project, would total approximately 7.4 MTCO2e/year. Actual emissions may vary, depending on the final construction schedules, equipment required, and activities conducted. Amortized construction-generated GHG emissions are included in the operational GHG emissions impact discussion provided below.

Amortized Construction Emissions  7.4  

See Appendix C for CalEEMod Results. MTCO2E = Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent Amortized emissions are quantified based on a 30-yer project life. 
Long-term Operational GHG Emissions Estimated long-term increases in GHG emissions associated with the proposed project are summarized in Table 4. As depicted, operational GHG emissions for the proposed project, with the inclusion of amortized construction GHGs, would total approximately 221.5 MTCO2e/year. A majority of the operational GHG emissions would be associated with energy use and the operation of motor vehicles. To a lesser extent, GHG emissions would also be associated with solid waste generation and water use. Project-generated GHG emissions are projected to decrease in future years due largely to improvements in energy-efficiency and vehicle fleet emission rates. Project-generated operational emissions would not exceed the significance threshold of 300 MTCO2e per year. As a result, the proposed project would not result in increased GHG emissions that would have a significant impact on the environment or conflict with GHG-reduction planning efforts. This impact would be considered less than significant.

Based on vehicle trip-generation rates derived from the traffic impact analysis prepared for this project. Mobile-source emissions for special events were adjusted assuming a total of 12 events annually, based on the conservative assumption that all vehicle trips would originate and end outside of the County. Actual mobile-source emissions, with inclusion of local trips, would be lower. 2. Area source emissions include landscape maintenance activities. 3.

IX. HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS -Would the project:  
a) Create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials?  X  
b) Create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment?  X  
c) Emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school?  X  
d) Be located on a site which is included on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, would it create a significant hazard to the public or the environment?  X  
e) For a project located within an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted, within two miles of a public airport or public use airport, would the project result in a safety hazard or excessive noise for people residing or working in the project area?  X  
f) Impair implementation of or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan?  X  
g) Expose people or structures, either directly or indirectly, to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires?  X  

a. 
Hazardous Substances: The project would not create reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment, as the project would not involve the storage or transport of substantial quantities of such materials. No impacts would occur. 

b. 
Hazardous Materials Releases: Refer to the discussion in Section a. above. However, the potential for soil contamination from past uses in this former agricultural area cannot be discounted. Therefore, the potential for contaminated soil on the project site exists and is considered a potentially significant impact unless mitigation is incorporated. A Phase I 


City of Buellton 
60 
Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) was prepared May 19, 2020 by the Phase One Group. Their Conclusions and Recommendations are summarized below. 
Conclusions 
The Phase I ESA revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions (RECs), historical recognized environmental conditions (HRECs), or controlled recognized environmental conditions (CRECs) in connection with the subject property, except for the following: 
• 
At the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit, an area of stained soil and gravel approximately eight feet by eight feet in size was observed within the on-site maintenance shop building. The stained soil and gravel represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 

• 
The subject property was historically used as a dairy farm operation. It is unknown 


where wastewater discharge generated from the former dairy farm operation was directed to at the subject property. The subject property soils in the area of the former dairy farm operation due to wastewater discharge may contain excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals. Based on the above, the former dairy farm operation represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 
• 
A retention basin appeared to be located on the southeastern portion of the subject property on the historical aerial photographs dated 1969, 1973, 1978 and 1981. The retention basin was no longer on-site at the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit. The subject property soils in the area of the retention basin may contain agricultural related chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, along with excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals. The subject property soils within the former retention basin location represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 

• 
Thenortheastern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes as an orchard on the historical aerial photograph dated 1928, and the southwestern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes on the historical aerial photographs dated 1973, 1978 and 1981. There is a potential that agricultural related chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers may have been used at the subject property. Based on the above, the former agricultural use at the subject property represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 


An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by The Phase One Group, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion. The following environmental issues were identified during the course of this assessment: 
• An unlabeled 88-gallon capacity portable above-ground storage tank (AST) reportedly containing diesel fuel was observed stored outside along the southeastern border of the subject property, an unlabeled 55-gallon capacity portable AST stored outside along the southwestern side of the barn, and numerous pails and containers of hydraulic oil, 
City of Buellton 
61 
lubricants and maintenance chemicals were observed stored outside adjacent to maintenance shop. No evidence of leaks or staining was observed in the areas of the ASTs and containers of hydraulic oil, lubricants and maintenance chemicals. 
•
 Based on the subject property use as a former dairyfarm operation, the possibility exists that the subject property is equipped with undocumented fuel underground storage tanks (USTs). No evidence of on-site USTs was observed during the site visit. 

• 
Although no evidence was identified during the site visit, historical on-site septic systems associated with the former on-site structures may be present on-site. 

• 
The subject property is equipped with one irrigation groundwater well located on the southern portion of the subject property. The irrigation groundwater well is reportedly not used for potable use as drinking water to the subject property is provided by the City of Buellton Water System. No additional information regarding the on-site groundwater well was provided to The Phase One Group. 


Recommendations 
As a result of this assessment, The Phase One Group recommends the following: 
• 
A limited subsurface investigation should be conducted at the subject property in order to determine the presence or absence of soil and/or groundwater contamination due to the former dairy farm operation and agricultural use, including the location of the former retention basin. (See Mitigation Measure HAZ-1.) 

• 
A limited subsurface investigation should be conducted in the area of oil-stained soil and gravel within the maintenance shop building. (See Mitigation Measure HAZ-2.) 

• 
The observed unlabeled 88-gallon capacity portable aboveground storage tank (AST) reportedly containing diesel fuel was observed stored outside along the southeastern border of the subject property, an unlabeled 55-gallon capacity portable AST stored outside along the southwestern side of the barn, and numerous pails and containers of hydraulic oil, lubricants and maintenance chemicals should be collected and properly disposed of by a certified hazardous waste hauler. (Note: this was completed at the time the City acquired subject property; documentation is part of escrow closing documents. Source: City .Manager.) 

• 
If on-site USTs are identified during redevelopment activities of the subject property, the USTs should be properly closed and removed following current regulatory procedures and guidelines. (See Mitigation Measure HAZ-3.) 

• 
If historical on-site septic systems are identified during redevelopment activities of the subject property, the historical on-site septic systems should be properly closed and removed following current regulatory procedures and guidelines. (See Mitigation Measure HAZ-4.) 

• 
If no longer in use, the irrigation groundwater well on the southern portion of the subject property should be properly decommissioned and closed utilizing current 


City of Buellton 
62 
regulatory standards and procedures. (Note: the well is still and will continue to be in use, thus mitigation is not applicable at this time.  Source:  City Manager.) 
c. Hazardous Materials Near Schools: The project site is not located within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school. The nearest schools are Jonata Middle School, which is about 
0.5 miles northeast of the project site; Oak Valley Elementary School is about 0.5 miles north of the project site; and Zaca Pre-School and After School is about 0.5 miles east of the site. No impacts are anticipated. 
d. 
Hazardous Materials Sites: The project site is not on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5.  No impacts would occur. 

e. 
Public Airport Safety Hazards: No public airports are in the vicinity of the project site. No impacts would occur. 

f. 
Emergency Response/Evacuation: The project site is not subject to an emergency response or evacuation plan, and would not interfere with any emergency response efforts on nearby streets. No impacts would occur. 

g. 
Wildland Fire Hazards: The site is not in a wildland fire hazard area as identified in the Safety Element of the Buellton General Plan. Impacts would be less than significant. 


Findings and Mitigation: The following mitigation measures are required to reduce project impacts related to hazardous materials to a less than significant level: 
Mitigation Measures 
HAZ-1: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment. Prior to issuance of land use permits, building permits, or the commencement of any grading, site preparation or ground disturbance activities, a limited subsurface investigation shall be conducted at the subject property in order to determine the presence or absence of soil and/or groundwater contamination due to the former dairy farm operation and agricultural use, including the location of the former retention basin.. 
Monitoring. The Planning Department will verify that the subsurface investigation has been completed and, if necessary, shall monitor any consequent mitigation activities. 
HAZ-2: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment. Prior to issuance of grading and/or building permits, a limited subsurface investigation should be conducted in the area of oil-stained soil and gravel within the maintenance shop building 
Monitoring. The Planning Department will verify that the subsurface investigation has been completed and, if necessary, shall monitor any consequent mitigation activities. 
HAZ-3: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment. If on-site USTs are identified during redevelopment activities of the subject property, the USTs should be properly closed and removed following current regulatory procedures and guidelines. 
City of Buellton 
63 
Monitoring: Upon notification of discovery of a potential find, the Planning Department will verify that the UST has been properly closed and removed in accordance with regulatory procedures in place at the time. 
HAZ-4: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment. If historical on-site septic systems are identified during redevelopment activities of the subject property, the historical on-site septic systems should be properly closed and removed following current regulatory procedures and guidelines. 
Monitoring: Upon notification of discovery of a potential find, the Planning Department will verify that the septic systems have been properly closed and removed in accordance with regulatory procedures in place at the time.  
ISSUES:  Potentially Significant Impact  Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated  Less Than Significant Impact  No Impact  
X.  HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY ­Would the project:  
a) Violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements or otherwise substantially degrade surface or groundwater quality?  X  
b) Substantially decrease groundwater supplies or interfere substantially with groundwater recharge such that the project may impede sustainable groundwater management of the basin?  X  
c) Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the alteration of the course of a stream or river or through the addition of impervious surfaces, in a manner which would:  X  
i. result in substantial erosion or siltation on-or off-site?  X  
ii. substantially increase the rate or amount of surface runoff in a manner that would result in flooding on-or off-site?  X  
iii. create or contribute runoff water which would exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage systems or provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff?  X  
iv. impede or redirect flood flows?  X  
d) In flood hazard, tsunami or seiche zones, risk release of pollutants due to project inundation?  X  
e) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of a water quality control plan or sustainable groundwater management plan?  X  

a. and e. RWQCB Standards. The proposed project would discharge wastewater into to the public sewer system via a private on-site sewer lift station for ultimate treatment at the City’s wastewater treatment plant. The Public Works Department will verify that all discharge requirements established by the Regional Water Quality Control Board are satisfied. An industrial discharge permit will be required for any processing or manufacturing uses that may occupy any of the space in the future. In addition, the project is required to, and does incorporate stormwater controls which provides water quality treatment of generated site run­off. Therefore, the impact is considered less than significant. 
City of Buellton 
64 
b. Groundwater Supply. Water is supplied to the City of Buellton from the Buellton Uplands Groundwater Basin, the Santa Ynez River Riparian Basin, and State Water Project (SWP). Water 
allocation from the SWP varies based on local demand and availability. Therefore, the City’s 
SWP supplies may fluctuate based on the quantity of water the City needs to meet demand and whether or not it is available from the State. Neither groundwater basin is in a state of overdraft, as the natural recharge rates either exceed the capacity of the basin or exceed the rate of pumping from the basin. Furthermore, previous studies indicate that the Buellton Uplands Groundwater Basin has a net surplus of 800 AFY. The project would create an incrementally increased demand for water, but the City has an adequate supply to accommodate the proposed project, and development at this location is already anticipated under the General Plan. Impacts would be less than significant. 
c. 
Runoff/Erosion and Siltation. Erosion and sedimentation to drainages could occur with grading activities, which could impact water quality. By law, all grading of the site must conform to the erosion control requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations. As such, erosion and siltation during the construction period would be minimized and would result in less than significant impacts. The project will also be required to comply with the City’s 2013 Stormwater Ordinance. 

d. 
Flood Hazards. Based on National Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and General Plan Floodplain maps, the lower portion of the project site is located within the 100-year flood zone. The Land Use Element of the General Plan designates this area as Open Space (which includes areas subject to flooding), to be used for public open space, parkland and recreation. Proposed uses consist of outdoor sports play fields, multi-use courts, play areas, supplemental parking and an accessory restroom facility (low profile, modular building); these uses are consistent with the Open Space designation. Potential impacts related to project construction and operation would be less than significant. The Public Works Department will review project plans to confirm that proposed grading and project implementation would not adversely affect the flood plain. The site is not located in the vicinity of any body of water that could result in a seiche or tsunami.  The project site is located in a dam failure inundation hazard area as identified in the City’s Safety Element of the General Plan. However, the number of persons using the site would not be significant, and adequate warning would be given to evacuate the site in the event of a possible dam failure. 


Findings and Mitigation: Since no significant impacts were identified, no mitigation is required. 
ISSUES:  Potentially Significant Impact  Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated  Less Than Significant Impact  No Impact  
XI. LAND USE AND PLANNING -Would the project:  
a) Physically divide an established community?  X  
b) Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect?  X  

City of Buellton 
65 
a. 
Physical Division of Established Communities. The proposed project is on the edge of existing development adjacent to an industrial and residential portion of the City. As such, it would not divide an established community. No impacts would occur. 

b. 
Policy Consistency. The proposed project is consistent with the applicable policies of the Buellton General Plan and meets the development standards of the Buellton Municipal Code.

The noise section has been prepared by Ambient under contract to the City of Buellton. All data used in the creation of this section is on file at the Buellton Planning Department and is hereby incorporated by reference into this Initial Study. Table numbers, figure numbers and appendix numbers shown in this section correspond to the May 2023 Noise and Groundborne Vibration Assessment prepared by Ambient, and included in in Appendix D to this Initial Study. 
Setting 
Extensive setting information, including the technical characteristics of noise and the regulatory framework for addressing noise issues, is included in the noise report attached as Appendix D. A brief summary of nearly noise-sensitive receptors and ambient noise levels is included below, and described more fully in Appendix D.  
Noise-Sensitive Receptors Noise-sensitive land uses are generally considered to include those uses where noise exposure could result in health-related risks to individuals, as well as places where quiet is an essential element of their intended purpose. Residential dwellings are of primary concern because of the potential for increased and prolonged exposure of individuals to both interior and exterior noise 
City of Buellton 
70 
levels. Additional land uses such as parks, historic sites, cemeteries, and recreation areas are also considered sensitive to increases in exterior noise levels. Schools, churches, hotels, libraries, and other places where low interior noise levels are essential are also considered noise-sensitive land uses. Noise-sensitive receptors in the project area consist predominantly of residential dwellings generally located north and east of the project site, River View Park is located adjacent to and west of the project site. 
Ambient Noise Levels To document existing ambient noise levels at the project site, short-term ambient noise measurements were conducted on April 20, 2023. Noise measurements were conducted using a SoftdB Piccolo Type II sound-level meter positioned at a height of approximately 5 feet above ground level. Noise measurement equipment was calibrated prior to and upon completion of the noise measurement survey. Measured ambient noise levels ranged from 41.2 to 44.6 dBA Leq. Based on the ambient noise measurements conducted, the noise environment in the proposed project area is defined primarily by vehicular traffic on area roadways. To a lesser extent, activities at nearby park and residential land uses (e.g., landscape maintenance) also contributes to ambient noise levels in the project area. 
Groundborne Vibration Vibration is like noise in that it involves a source, a transmission path, and a receiver. While vibration is related to noise, it differs in that noise is generally considered to be pressure waves transmitted through air, whereas vibration usually consists of the excitation of a structure or 
surface. As with noise, vibration consists of amplitude and frequency. A person’s perception of 
the vibration will depend on their individual sensitivity to vibration, as well as the amplitude and frequency of the source and the response of the system which is vibrating. Vibration can be measured in terms of acceleration, velocity, or displacement. Measurements in terms of velocity are expressed as peak particle velocity (ppv) with units of inches per second (in/sec). 
There are no federal, state, or local regulatory standards for groundborne vibration. However, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has developed vibration criteria based on potential structural damage risks and human annoyance, which are summarized in Table 5 of Appendix D. 
Significance Thresholds 
The CEQA Guidelines do not define the levels at which temporary and permanent increases in 
ambient noise are considered “substantial.” As discussed previously in this section, a noise level 
increase of 3 dBA is barely perceptible to most people, an increase of 5 dBA is readily noticeable, and a difference of 10 dBA would be perceived as a doubling of loudness. In accordance with the City of Buellton General Plan noise standards, a significant increase in ambient noise levels would be defined as an increase of 5 dBA or greater for an ambient noise level of less than 60 dB; a 3 dB, or greater, increase in an ambient noise level of 60-65 dB; or a 
1.5 dB greater, increase in an ambient noise level above 65 dB (Refer to Table 2). In order for a receptor to have a significant impact there would need to be a substantial increase that would also exceed the City’s applicable noise standards, as summarized in Table 3 of Appendix D. 
The CEQA Guidelines also do not define the levels at which groundborne vibration levels would be considered excessive. For this reason, Caltrans recommended groundborne vibration thresholds were used for the evaluation of impacts based on increased potential for structural 
City of Buellton 
71 
damage and human annoyance, as identified in Table 5 of Appendix D. For purposes of this analysis, risks of architectural damage (i.e., minor cracking of plaster walls and ceilings) and significant increases in human annoyance would be considered potentially significant if ground vibration levels at nearby structures would exceed 0.5 in/sec ppv. 
Methodology 
Construction Impacts Short-term noise impacts associated with construction activities were analyzed based on typical construction equipment noise levels and distances to the nearest noise-sensitive land usage. Noise levels were predicted based on representative off-road equipment noise levels derived 
from the Federal HighwayAdministration’s (FHWA) RoadwayConstruction Noise Model based 
on average equipment usage rates and assuming a noise-attenuation rate of 6 dB per doubling of distance from the source. 
Operational Impacts Noise levels generated by other on-site noise sources, including paly areas, sports fields, and event center activities were assessed based on representative noise levels obtained from similar sources. Noise levels associated with vehicle parking areas were calculated in accordance with 
FTA’s Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment Guidelines (2018) assuming a reference 
noise level of 92 dBA SEL. Average-hourly noise levels associated with vehicle parking-related activities were calculated based on the conservative assumption that all parking spaces would be accessed over a one-hour period. Increases in traffic noise levels were qualitatively assessed based, in part, on data derived from the traffic analysis prepared for this project and the City of Buellton General Plan Noise Element (ATE 2023, City of Buellton 2005). 
Impact Analysis 
a. The analysis that follows is a summarized version of what is included in the noise report included as Appendix D. 
Construction-Related Noise Levels Construction noise typically occurs intermittently and varies depending upon the nature or phase (e.g., land clearing, grading, excavation, and erection) of the activity. Noise generated by construction equipment, including earthmovers, material handlers, and portable generators, can reach high levels. Noise levels commonly associated with off-road equipment anticipated to be used during project construction are summarized in Table 6 of Appendix D. As shown in that table, instantaneous noise levels generated by individual pieces of off-road equipment typically range from approximately 77 to 90 dBA Lmax at 50 feet. Typical operating cycles may involve 2 minutes of full power, followed by 3 or 4 minutes at lower settings. Based on typical off-road equipment usage rates, average-hourly noise levels for individual equipment would be approximately 83 dBA Leq, or less, at 50 feet. Assuming that multiple pieces of equipment could be operating simultaneously, predicted average-hourly noise levels could reach levels of approximately 85 dBA Leq at 50 feet. 
The nearest noise-sensitive receivers to the project site include existing residences generally located to the north and east of the project site. Assuming an average-hourly construction noise level of 85 dBA Leq at 50 feet and that construction activities were to occur at the nearest property boundary, predicted noise levels could potentially exceed the City’s noise standard of 
City of Buellton 
72 
75 dBA Leq at nearby residential land uses. With regard to residential land uses, activities occurring during the more noise-sensitive nighttime hours are of particular concern given the potential for sleep disruption and increased levels of annoyance for building occupants. For these reasons, this impact would be considered potentially significant. 
Mitigation Measures 
Mitigation Measure Noise-1. The following measures shall be implemented to reduce construction-generated noise levels: 
a) 
Construction activity shall be limited to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, and between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays (with City approval). Noise-generating construction activities shall be prohibited on Sundays and state or federal holidays. Construction equipment maintenance shall be limited to the same hours. 

b) 
Control noise at all construction sites through the provision of mufflers and the physical separation of machinery maintenance and equipment staging areas from adjacent residential land uses. 

c) 
Construction activities shall comply with the City of Buellton’s noise-control ordinance requirements, including obtaining a permit if deemed necessary. 


Significance After Mitigation 
Implementation of the above mitigation measures would limit construction activities to less noise-sensitive periods of the day. The use of mufflers would reduce construction equipment noise levels by approximately 10 dBA. With the implementation of the above mitigation measures and given that construction activities would be short-term and intermittent, this impact would be considered less than significant. 
Operational Noise Levels Long-term, permanent increases in ambient noise levels would be primarily associated with potential increases in vehicle traffic on nearby roadways, as well as on-site activities. Noise levels commonly associated with these sources and potential impacts to nearby land uses are discussed as follows: 
Vehicular Roadway Traffic. Typically, several thousand vehicles per day would be required before traffic noise levels along roadways would begin to exceed applicable noise standards at nearby noise-sensitive land uses. In addition, a double of vehicle traffic is typically required before a noticeable increase (i.e., 3 dB, or greater) in traffic noise levels would occur. Implementation of the proposed project would not result in a doubling of vehicle traffic along nearby major roadways. As a result, implementation of the proposed project would not result in a significant increase in traffic noise levels that would exceed applicable noise standards at nearby land uses. Other nearby local roadways in the project vicinity do not have sufficient volumes. This impact would be considered less than significant. 
Compatibility of Proposed Land Uses with Predicted Future Traffic Noise Levels. As previously discussed, ambient noise levels at the project site are primarily influenced by vehicle traffic on area roadways. The nearest major roadway in the project vicinity is State Highway 246. The project site is not located within the predicted noise contours of major roadways (City of Buellton 2008). In addition, based on the ambient noise measurement surveys conducted, 
City of Buellton 
73 
ambient noise levels in the project area would not exceed the City’s “normally acceptable” noise standards for land use compatibility of 65 dBA CNEL/Ldn. This impact would be considered 
less than significant. 
Non-Transportation Noise Sources. Non-transportation noise sources associated with the proposed project having the greatest potential to adversely impact nearby residential land uses would be primarily associated with sports fields, special events, play areas, and vehicle parking lots. Predicted noise levels at the nearest residential land uses associated with these noise sources are summarized in Table 5. As depicted, predicted noise levels associated with these major onsite 
noise sources would not exceed the City’s daytime noise standard of 65 dBA Leq at the property 
line of the nearest residential land uses. It is important to note that River View Park operational hours are typically limited to between the daytime hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. However, in the event that special events were to extend beyond normal operational hours, predicted noise 
levels at nearby residential land uses could potentially exceed the City’s nighttime noise standard 
of 45 dBA Leq. To be conservative, this impact is considered potentially significant.

1. Based on distance from source center to the nearest residential property line. 2. Predicted noise levels were calculated based on noise measurement surveys at similar land uses. Parking lot noise levels were calculated assuming a maximum of 112 parking spaces at one location with all spaces accessed over a one-hour period. Parking noise levels were calculated using the FTA Noise Impact Assessment Spreadsheet (2018). Predicted noise levels exceeding applicable noise standard depicted in bold. 3. Daytime is between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 4. Nighttime is between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.  

Mitigation Measures 
Mitigation Measure Noise-2. Special events shall be prohibited between the hours of 
10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
Significance after Mitigation 
With the implementation of Mitigation Measure Noise-2, this impact would be considered less than significant. 
b. Increases in groundborne vibration levels attributable to the proposed project would be primarily associated with short-term construction activities. Groundborne vibration levels associated with representative construction equipment likely to be required during project construction are summarized in Table 8 of Appendix D. As depicted, construction-generated vibration levels would range from approximately 0.003 to 0.21 in/sec ppv at 25 feet. The highest vibration levels would be associated with the use of vibratory rollers. 
Implementation of the proposed project would not involve the demolition of existing structures. Offroad equipment used in the general vicinity of existing onsite and offsite structures, such as 
City of Buellton 
74 
development of the children’s play area, would consist of smaller tractors and equipment. The 
use of larger heavy-duty equipment and vibratory rollers would not be largely associated with construction activities occurring in the southern portion of the project site associated with construction of the sports fields, as well as, parking areas. The use of larger off-road equipment and vibratory rollers would not be anticipated to occur within 25 feet of existing structures As a result, predicted construction vibration levels at existing structures would not exceed the minimum recommended criteria for structural damage or human annoyance (0.5 and 0.4 in/sec ppv, respectively). This impact would be considered less than significant. 
c. The project site is not located within 2 miles of a public airport or private airstrip or within an airport land use planning area. The nearest airport is the Santa Ynez Airport, which is located approximately 7 miles east of the project site. The proposed project would not result in exposure of individuals to aircraft noise levels that would exceed applicable noise standards. As a result, this impact would be considered less than significant.

XVII. TRANSPORTATION/TRAFFIC ­Would the project:  
a) Conflict with a program, plan, ordinance or policy addressing the circulation system, including transit, roadway, bicycle and pedestrian facilities?  X  
b) Conflict or be inconsistent with CEQA Guidelines § 15064.3, subdivision (b)?  X  
c) Substantially increase hazards to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment)?  X  
d) Result in inadequate emergency access?  X  

a. and b. A trip generation study (March 10, 2023) has been prepared by Associated Transportation Engineers (ATE) for the project, and is included as Appendix E to this Initial Study. The findings of that study are summarized below and incorporated by reference. Background information in this analysis is also based on previous recent traffic reports prepared for other projects in Buellton. All relevant traffic studies are available for review at the Buellton Planning Department, 107 West Highway 246, Buellton and on the City of Buellton website. 
Regional access to the project site is provided by US 101 via the SR 246 interchange. Vehicular access to the upper portion of the project site is proposed via a connection to Valley Dairy Drive. Vehicular access to the lower portion is proposed through River View Park via Sycamore Drive. 
Existing Conditions 
Existing Street Network 
The circulation system is comprised of regional highways, arterials and collector streets, which are illustrated on Figure 1 of the Transportation Analysis dated July 18, 2017. The following text discusses the major roadways serving the site. 
US Highway 101, located east of the Project, is a multi-lane highway serving the California coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco. US Highway 101 is 4-lanes wide in the City of Buellton and provides regional access to the Project. 
SR 246, located north of the Project site, is an east-west state highway which extends from the Pacific Ocean west of Lompoc through Buellton, Solvang and Santa Ynez, to SR 154 on the east. SR 246 is a 4-lane arterial from the western Buellton city limit to Freear Drive near the Eastern city limit. 
Avenue of Flags is a north-south arterial roadway which parallels the west side of US Highway 
101. Avenue of Flags serves the business area of Buellton between the US 101 SB off-ramp and the Flying Flags RV Resort.  
Industrial Way, located just east of the Project site is a north-south collector street which terminates approximately ¼ mile south of SR 246. Access to the Project is proposed via 2 driveways on Industrial Way that will serve the Project and the Terravant Wine building. 
City of Buellton 
77 
Sycamore Drive, located near the Project site, is a north-south collector street which terminates approximately a quarter-mile north and south of SR 246. 
Project Trip Generation 
The Willemsen Addition is an expansion of River View Park and is intended primarily for use by Buellton area residents. The traffic will generally be local in nature and not intended to be a regional destination and draw for the general public from other areas. Much of the activity and usage will be on weekends, with the possibility that some soccer related activities would occur on weekday afternoons. The AM and PM peak hour traffic will be minimal and will not affect the roadway or intersection operations in the Buellton area. 
The proposed library and meeting room in the converted single-family residence will be a relocation of the existing library located in the existing Post Office complex, thus no increase in local traffic volumes. 
Average daily trips for each of the activities are based on the probable numbers expected to attend events. A summary of the trips is shown in Table 6. 
Table 6. Project Trip Generation 
Activity/Use  Attendance/Size  ADT  
Rate  Trips  
Library  N/A  N/A  N/A  
Large Events  150  1 per 2.5  40

Soccer  150  1 per 2.5  60  
Children’s Museum Addition  20  0.5  10  
Total Trips  174  

As shown in Table 6, the proposed project is forecast to generate a daily equivalent of 174 average daily trips. 
Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) Analysis 
The Willemsen Addition is considered a “Small Project” under the City of Buellton CEQA 
Guidelines, thus the VMT impact would be considered less than significant. 
Summary 
The Willemsen Addition to River View Park Project is forecast to generate a daily equivalent ADT of 174 trips. Recent State law has adopted Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) as the new CEQA metric to determine transportation impacts. The Project is considered a “Small Project“ and therefore would have a less than significant VMT impact based on the City of Buellton CEQA guidelines. 
City of Buellton 
78 
Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities 
There are existing pedestrian sidewalks along both sides of Industrial Way from SR 246 and its terminus. Pedestrian sidewalks are also provided on both sides of State Route 246 between 
Avenue of Flags and Sycamore Drive. The City of Buellton’s bicycle and pedestrian master plan 
proposes Class II bicycle routes for State Route 246 and Class III bicycle routes for Industrial Way. These facilities will be able to accommodate pedestrian and bicycle traffic generated by the Project. 
c. 
Traffic Hazards. The project would not introduce any traffic hazards, since no new roadways would be built.  No impacts would occur. 

d. 
Emergency Access. The proposed project would not block or impair any identified emergency access routes, nor would it generate traffic that could impair such routes. Impacts would be less than significant. 


Findings and Mitigation: Project impacts would be less than significant, and no mitigation is required. 
ISSUES:   Potentially Significant Impact  Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated  Less Than Significant Impact  No Impact  
XVIII. TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES ­Would the project:  
a) Would the project cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a tribal cultural resource, defined in Public Resources Code section 21074 as either a site, feature, place, cultural landscape that is geographically defined in terms of the size and scope of the landscape, sacred place, or object with cultural value to a California Native American tribe, and that is:  
i) Listed or eligible for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources, or in a local register of historical resources as defined in Public Resources Code section 5020.1(k), or  X  
ii) A resource determined by the lead agency, in its discretion and supported by substantial evidence, to be significant pursuant to criteria set forth in subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code Section 5024.1. In applying the criteria set forth in subdivision (c) of Public Resource Code Section 5024.1, the lead agency shall consider the significance of the resource to a California Native American tribe.  X  

a. Tribal Cultural Resources. The property consists of an existing residence, barn and accessory structures as well as a large, predominantly open space area with disturbed land, formerly used as a dairy farm, which is currently vacant and occasionally used as overflow parking for larger events at River View Park. The site is highly disturbed as a result of past flooding events. Therefore, if any tribal cultural resources were present on the site in the past, it is highly unlikely that they would be present today. Additionally, Mitigation Measure CR-1 in the Cultural Resources section includes a Halt Work Order requirement in the unlikely event that any cultural resources are discovered. The procedures laid out in this mitigation measure would be followed in the event any cultural resources are discovered. The City will follow the required AB52 
City of Buellton

XIX. UTILITIES AND SERVICE SYSTEMS Would the project:  
a) Require or result in the relocation or construction of new or expanded water, wastewater treatment or storm water drainage, electric power, natural gas, or telecommunications facilities, the construction or relocation of which could cause significant environmental effects?  X  
b) Have sufficient water supplies available to serve the project and reasonably foreseeable future development during normal, dry and multiple dry years?  X  
c) Result in a determination by the wastewater treatment provider, which serves or may serve the project that it has adequate capacity to serve the project's projected demand in addition to the provider's existing commitments?  X  
d) Generate solid waste in excess of state or local standards, or in excess of the capacity of local infrastructure, or otherwise impair the attainment of solid waste reduction goals?  X  
e) Comply with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations related to solid waste?  X  

a. and c. Water and Wastewater Facility and Other Utility Infrastructure. The General Plan already accounts for development of the intensity proposed as part of the project. Therefore, its water consumption and wastewater generation characteristics are already accounted for in the General Plan and associated Environmental Impact Report. There would be no residents at the site. The City has adequate water supply with its three sources of water. The City’s wastewater treatment plant has a total capacity of 650,000 gallons per day, and has a current average daily flow of approximately 450,000 gallons per day. The existing wastewater treatment plant and 
sewer mains have sufficient capacity to accommodate the project’s flows. Impacts would be less than significant. 
The project would not significantly impact nor require the construction of any other utility infrastructure, including power supply and telecommunications. 
b. 
Water Supplies. This project would increase the demand for domestic water from the City’s supplies; however, the City has adequate supply to service the project without obtaining new or expanded water entitlements. The City has an estimated water supply capacity of 1,563 acre-feet per year. The estimated water demand for the project is 5.4 acre-feet per year. Impacts would be less than significant. 

d.
 and e.  Solid Waste. No significant solid waste impacts have been identified with respect to the proposed project. The project would be required to comply with all applicable state and local regulations with respect to solid waste disposal. 


Findings and Mitigation: No significant impacts would occur, so no mitigation is required.

ISSUES:  Potentially Significant Impact  Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated  Less Than Significant Impact  No Impact  
XX. WILDFIRE -Would the project:  
a) Substantially impair an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan?  X  
b) Due to slope, prevailing winds, and other factors, exacerbate wildfire risks, and thereby expose project occupants to pollutant concentrations from a wildfire or the uncontrolled spread of a wildfire?  X  
c) Require the installation or maintenance of associated infrastructure (such as roads, fuel breaks, emergency water sources, power lines or other utilities) that may exacerbate fire risk or that may result in temporary or ongoing impacts to the environment?  X  
d) Expose people or structures to significant risks, including downslope or downstream flooding or landslides, as a result of runoff, post-fire slope instability, or drainage changes?  X  

a. Emergency Response/Evacuation. The proposed project would not block or impair any identified emergency access routes, nor would it generate traffic that could impair such routes. The project would not impair any emergency response or evacuation plan, and would not interfere with any emergency response efforts on nearby streets. No impacts would occur. 
b., c. and d. Wildland Fire Hazards. The site is not in a wildland fire hazard area as identified in the Safety Element of the Buellton General Plan. The site is flat, and vegetation on the site would be well-maintained as part of the project, minimizing wildland fire risk. No fuel breaks or emergency water infrastructure are proposed or necessary to address potential risks. The site is not subject to landslides, and development would occur outside the floodplain, so secondary risks related to slope instability from fires is minimal. If the Fire Department determines the need, the project would be subject to conditions of approval related to reducing fire risk outside of the CEQA process.  Impacts would be less than significant. 
Findings and Mitigation: No significant impacts would occur, so no mitigation is required.

XXI. MANDATORY FINDINGS OF SIGNIFICANCE  Potentially Significant Impact  Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated  Less Than Significant Impact  No Impact  
a) Does the project have the potential to degrade the quality of the environment, substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community, reduce the number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal or eliminate important examples of the major periods of California history or prehistory?  X  
b) Does the project have impacts that are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable? ("Cumulatively considerable" means that the incremental effects of a project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects)?  X  
c) Does the project have environmental effects that will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly?  X  

a. Impacts related to drainage and water quality were determined to be less than significant. 
Compliance with stormwater and other water quality regulations ensures that the project’s 
impacts are not cumulatively considerable. Potential impacts related to biological resources and cultural resources were identified, however the appropriate mitigation measures have been included to mitigate these impacts to a less than significant level and ensure that there are no cumulatively considerable impacts. The project is also required to comply with federal, state and local laws that address these resources. Standard conditions of approval would also apply. There are no important examples of major period of California history or prehistory that will be impacted by this project. 
b. 
No potential cumulative impacts were identified for the project. 

c. 
The incorporation of required mitigation measures and adherence to General Plan policies would reduce all impacts that have the potential to affect human beings to a less than significant level.

INTRODUCTION 
This report provides an analysis of noise impacts associated with the City of Buellton’s Willemsen Addition to 
River View Park. This report also provides a summary of existing conditions in the project area and the applicable regulatory framework pertaining to air quality and climate change. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The Project consists of a Final Development Plan (22-FDP-XX) to construct a multi-purpose recreational and event facility on a 24+/-acre site (APNs 099-660-032, -033, -034, -035, & 099-670-005). The site is divided into a 4-acre upper portion and a 20-acre lower portion. Figure 1 illustrates the Project site plan. 
The upper portion (about 4 acres) contains an existing residence (3,200 square feet), an existing dairy barn (designated as a historic structure by the City of Buellton), and an existing 1,600 square foot open storage shed. The lower portion (about 20 acres) is vacant (except for the 1.25-acre horseback riding facility already operating). Was formerly used for hay farming (at least 8-10 years ago). 
Proposed uses for the upper portion consist of: 
• 
Library (approximately 2,430 square feet) and Community rooms (1,565 square feet) in converted existing residence -Given library facilities in Solvang, Goleta, Lompoc, and Los Alamos, library patrons are expected to primarily be residents of Buellton and nearby rural residents. 

• 
Wedding/Event facility in Barn (about 7,000 square feet) includes warming kitchen and 2nd floor apartment space (up to 150 persons per event). These events are expected to occur about 1 per month; 

• 
Outdoor active play area “Children’s Museum” -about 30,00 square feet of area, including 1,600 square feet of covered space (current open storage shed). Restroom facilities and play equipment to be installed. This use is intended to serve the general Santa Ynez Valley population. 


Proposed uses for the lower portion consist of: 
• 
1.25-acre horseback riding center (horse corrals and small office structure w/ storage. Approximately 24 trips per day maximum anticipated; 

• 
Paved parking lot (about 1.5 acres) with about 112 parking spaces to serve upper and lower portion uses. Future restroom facility. Parking area to be reached by new access road across (non­jurisdictional) drainage channel from River View Park east parking lot; 

• 
Possible 10,000 square feet expansion of Children’s Museum play area 

• 
Sport facilities/play fields (about 15 acres) with parking and restroom facilities: 2 full sized soccer fields, of which 1 will not be available for open play, but only used for infrequent club events, 1 mid-sized field, and 1 small sized soccer field, baseball/softball field, 2 pickleball/multi-use courts, some supplemental parking (40 spaces) and restroom facility -non-club fields and courts will primarily serve local valley recreational needs. Soccer fields could accommodate small tournaments (4 per year max anticipated). Approximately 2,150 trips generated per tournament over the course of an 8 to 10-hour day. Tournaments held in this location are expected to relocate here from other less desirable sites in the Santa Ynez Valley that are currently used for soccer tournaments; 

• 
Assume about 2.5 acres to remain undeveloped (berm along south boundary of property/well area).

AIR QUALITY 
Existing Setting 
Nearby Land Uses 
Land uses located near the project site include a mix of commercial, medical, and residential land uses. The nearest commercial land uses are located approximately 50 feet to the north and approximately 100 feet to the east (Home Motors). The nearest medical land uses are located approximately 600 feet to the south. The nearest residential land uses include multi-family residences located approximately 400 feet to the north. 
Meteorological Conditions 
The City of Buellton is located in the South Central Coast Air Basin (SCCAB), which includes all of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties and is within the jurisdiction of the SBCAPCD. 
The air quality in the SCCAB is influenced by both local topography and meteorological conditions. Surface and upper-level wind flow vary both seasonally and geographically in the SCCAB and inversion conditions common to the area can affect the vertical mixing and dispersion of pollutants. The prevailing wind flow patterns in the SCCAB are not necessarily those that cause high ozone values. High ozone values are often associated with atypical wind flow patterns. Meteorological and topographical influences are important to air quality in Santa Barbara County and throughout the SCCAB. Semi-permanent high pressure that lies off the Pacific Coast generally leads to limited rainfall, with warm, dry summers and relatively damp winters. Maximum summer temperatures average about 70 degrees Fahrenheit near the coast and in the high 80s to 90s inland. During winter, average minimum temperatures range from the 40s along the coast to the 30s inland. Additionally, cool, humid, marine air causes frequent fog and low clouds along the coast, generally during the night and morning hours in the late spring and early summer. The fog and low clouds can persist for several days until broken up by a change in the weather pattern (SBCAPCD 2001). 
In the northern portion of the county (north of the ridgeline of the Santa Ynez Mountains), the sea breeze (from sea to land) is typically northwesterly throughout the year while the prevailing sea breeze in the southern portion of the county is from the southwest. During summer, these winds are stronger and persist later into the night. At night, the sea breeze weakens and is replaced by light land breezes (from land to sea). The alternation of the land-sea breeze cycle can sometimes produce a "sloshing" effect, where pollutants are swept offshore at night and subsequently carried back onshore during the day. This effect is exacerbated during periods when wind speeds are low (SBCAPCD 2001). 
The terrain around Point Conception, combined with the change in orientation of the coastline from north-south to east-west can cause counterclockwise circulation (eddies) to form east of the Point. These eddies fluctuate temporally and spatially, often leading to highly variable winds along the southern coastal strip. Point Conception also marks the change in the prevailing surface winds from northwesterly to southwesterly (SBCAPCD 2001). 
Santa Ana winds are northeasterly winds that occur primarily during fall and winter, but occasionally in spring. These are warm, dry winds blown from the high inland desert that descend down the slopes of a mountain range. Wind speeds associated with Santa Ana’s are generally 15-20 mph, though they can sometimes reach speeds in excess of 60 mph. During Santa Ana conditions, pollutants emitted in Santa Barbara, Ventura County, and the South Coast Air Basin (the Los Angeles region) are moved out to sea. These pollutants can then be moved back onshore into Santa Barbara County in what is called a "post-Santa Ana condition." The effects of the post-Santa Ana condition can be experienced throughout the county. Not all post-Santa Ana conditions, however, lead to high pollutant concentrations in Santa Barbara County (SBCAPCD 2001). 
Upper-level winds (measured at Vandenberg Air Force Base once each morning and afternoon) are generally from the north or northwest throughout the year, but occurrences of southerly and easterly winds do occur in winter, especially during the morning. Upper-level winds from the south and east are infrequent during the summer. When they do occur during summer, they are usually associated with periods of high ozone levels. Surface and upper-level winds can move pollutants that originate in other areas into the county (SBCAPCD 2001).

Surface temperature inversions (0-500 ft) are most frequent during the winter, and subsidence inversions (1000-2000 ft) are most frequent during the summer. Inversions are an increase in temperature with height and are directly related to the stability of the atmosphere. Inversions act as a cap to the pollutants that are emitted below or within them and ozone concentrations are often higher directly below the base of elevated inversions than they are at the earth’s surface. For this reason, elevated monitoring sites will occasionally record higher ozone concentrations than sites at lower elevations. Generally, the lower the inversion base height and the greater the rate of temperature increase from the base to the top, the more pronounced effect the inversion will have on inhibiting vertical dispersion. The subsidence inversion is very common during summer along the California coast and is one of the principal causes of air stagnation (SBCAPCD 2001). 
Poor air quality is usually associated with "air stagnation" (high stability/restricted air movement). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect a higher frequency of pollution events in the southern portion of the county where light winds are frequently observed, as opposed to the northern part of the county where the prevailing winds are usually strong and persistent (SBCAPCD 2001). 
Criteria Air Pollutants 
For the protection of public health and welfare, the Clean Air Act (CAA) required that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for various pollutants. These pollutants are referred to as "criteria" pollutants because the U.S. EPA publishes criteria documents to justify the choice of standards. These standards define the maximum amount of an air 
pollutant that can be present in ambient air without harm to the public’s health. An ambient air quality 
standard is generally specified as a concentration averaged over a specific time period, such as one hour, eight hours, 24 hours, or one year. The different averaging times and concentrations are meant to protect against different exposure effects. The CAA allows states to adopt additional or more health-protective standards. The air quality regulatory framework and ambient air quality standards are discussed in greater detail later in this report. 
Human Health & Welfare Effects 
Common air pollutants and associated adverse health and welfare effects are summarized in Table AQ-1. Within the SCCAB, the air pollutants of primary concern, with regard to human health, include ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), and carbon monoxide (CO). As depicted in Table AQ-1, exposure to increased pollutant concentrations of O3, PM, and CO can result in various heart and lung ailments, cardiovascular and nervous system impairment, and death. 
Odors 
Typically, odors are generally regarded as an annoyance rather than a health hazard. However, manifestations of a person’s reaction to foul odors can range from psychological (i.e., irritation, anger, or anxiety) to the physiological, including circulatory and respiratory effects, nausea, vomiting, and headache. 
Neither the state nor the federal governments have adopted rules or regulations for the control of odor sources. The SBCAPCD does not have an individual rule or regulation that specifically addresses odors; however, odors would be applicable to SBCAPCD Rule 303, Nuisance. Any actions related to odors would be based on citizen complaints to local governments and the SBCAPCD. The SBCAPCD recommends that odor impacts be addressed in a qualitative manner. Such analysis shall determine if the project results in excessive nuisance odors, as defined under the California Code of Regulations, Health & Safety Code Section 41700, air quality public nuisance.

Toxic Air Contaminants 
Toxic air contaminants (TACs) are air pollutants that may cause or contribute to an increase in mortality or serious illness, or which may pose a hazard to human health. TACs are usually present in minute quantities in the ambient air, but due to their high toxicity, they may pose a threat to public health even at very low concentrations. Because there is no threshold level below which adverse health impacts are not expected to occur, TACs differ from criteria pollutants for which acceptable levels of exposure can be determined and for which state and federal governments have set ambient air quality standards. TACs, therefore, are not 
considered “criteria pollutants” under either the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) or the California Clean Air Act 
(CCAA) and are thus not subject to National or State Ambient Air Quality Standards (AAQS). TACs are not considered criteria pollutants in that the FCAA and CCAA do not address them specifically through the setting of National or State AAQS. Instead, the U.S. EPA and California Air Resources Board (ARB) regulate Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) and TACs, respectively, through statutes and regulations that generally require the use of the maximum or best available control technology to limit emissions. In conjunction with District rules, these federal and state statutes and regulations establish the regulatory framework for TACs. At the national level, the U.S. EPA has established National Emission Standards for HAPs (NESHAPs), in accordance with the requirements of the FCAA and subsequent amendments. These are technology-based source-specific regulations that limit allowable emissions of HAPs. 
Within California, TACs are regulated primarily through the Tanner Air Toxics Act (Assembly Bill [AB] 1807) and the Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act of 1987 (AB 2588). The Tanner Act sets forth a formal procedure for ARB to designate substances as TACs. This includes research, public participation, and scientific peer review before ARB designates a substance as a TAC. Existing sources of TACs that are subject to the Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act are required to: (1) prepare a toxic emissions inventory; (2) prepare a risk assessment if emissions are significant; (3) notify the public of significant risk levels; and (4) prepare and implement risk reduction measures. 
At the state level, the ARB has authority for the regulation of emissions from motor vehicles, fuels, and consumer products. More recently, diesel-exhaust particulate matter (DPM) was added to the ARB list of TACs. DPM is the primary TACs of concern for mobile sources. Of all controlled TACs, emissions of DPM are estimated to be responsible for about 70 percent of the total ambient TAC risk. The ARB has made the reduction of the public’s exposure to DPM one of its highest priorities, with an aggressive plan to require cleaner diesel fuel and cleaner diesel engines and vehicles (ARB 2005). 
At the local level, air districts have authority over stationary or industrial sources. For SBCAPCD, if a project may emit TACs, or if toxic contaminants may already be present at the project site, and there are sensitive receptors nearby, a screening health risk assessment using worst-case scenario assumptions may be warranted. 
Asbestos 
Asbestos is the common name for a group of naturally-occurring fibrous silicate minerals that can separate into thin but strong and durable fibers. Naturally-occurring asbestos (NOA), which was identified as a TAC in 1986 by ARB, is located in many parts of California and is commonly associated with ultramafic rock. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) may be present in existing structures. The demolition of existing structures may be subject to regulatory requirements for the control of ACM. 
SBCAPCD states that if a residential building with more than four units or a commercial building is to be 
demolished or renovated, or the structure is considered a “regulated structure” (e.g., bridges, caissons, etc.), 
the project proponent must complete SBCAPCD Form ENF-28: Notification for Renovation and Demolition or APCD Form ENF-28e: EXEMPTION from Notification for Renovation and Demolition and the SBCAPCD must be notified even if the building does not contain any asbestos. However, if the project is only a renovation, no notification is required unless the renovation involves disturbing a threshold amount of regulated asbestos materials (SBCAPCD 2021b).

Regulatory Framework 
Air quality within the SCCAB is regulated by several jurisdictions including the U.S. EPA, ARB, and the SBCAPCD. Each of these jurisdictions develops rules, regulations, and policies to attain the goals or directives imposed upon them through legislation. 
Federal 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
At the federal level, the U.S. EPA has been charged with implementing national air quality programs. The U.S. EPA’s air quality mandates are drawn primarily from the FCAA, which was signed into law in 1970. Congress substantially amended the FCAA in 1977 and again in 1990. 
Federal Clean Air Act 
The FCAA required the U.S. EPA to establish NAAQS, and also set deadlines for their attainment. Two types of NAAQS have been established: primary standards, which protect public health, and secondary standards, which protect public welfare from non-health-related adverse effects, such as visibility restrictions. NAAQS are summarized in Table AQ-2. 
State 
California Air Resources Board 
The ARB is the agency responsible for coordination and oversight of state and local air pollution control programs in California and for implementing the CCAA of 1988. Other ARB duties include monitoring air quality (in conjunction with air monitoring networks maintained by air pollution control districts and air quality management districts, establishing California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS), which in many cases are more stringent than the NAAQS, and setting emissions standards for new motor vehicles. The CAAQS are summarized in Table AQ-2. The emission standards established for motor vehicles differ depending on various factors including the model year, and the type of vehicle, fuel, and engine used. 
California Clean Air Act 
The CCAA requires that all air districts in the state endeavor to achieve and maintain CAAQS for O3, CO, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and NO2 by the earliest practicable date. The CCAA specifies that districts focus particular attention on reducing the emissions from transportation and area-wide emission sources, and the act provides districts with authority to regulate indirect sources. Each district plan is required to either (1) achieve a five percent annual reduction, averaged over consecutive 3-year periods, in district-wide emissions of each non-attainment pollutant or its precursors, or (2) to provide for the implementation of all feasible measures to reduce emissions. Any planning effort for air quality attainment would thus need to consider both state and federal planning requirements. 
Assembly Bills 1807 & 2588 -Toxic Air Contaminants 
Within California, TACs are regulated primarily through AB 1807 (Tanner Air Toxics Act) and AB 2588 (Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act of 1987). The Tanner Air Toxics Act sets forth a formal procedure for ARB to designate substances as TACs. This includes research, public participation, and scientific peer review before ARB designates a substance as a TAC. Existing sources of TACs that are subject to the Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act are required to: (1) prepare a toxic emissions inventory; (2) prepare a risk assessment if emissions are significant; (3) notify the public of significant risk levels; and (4) prepare and implement risk reduction measures.

In-Use Off-Road Diesel Vehicle Regulation 
On July 26, 2007, the ARB adopted a regulation to reduce DPM and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from in-use (existing) off-road heavy-duty diesel vehicles in California. The regulation applies to self-propelled diesel-fueled vehicles that cannot be registered and licensed to drive on-road, as well as two-engine vehicles that drive on road, with the limited exception of two-engine sweepers. Examples include loaders, crawler tractors, skid steers, backhoes, forklifts, airport ground support equipment, water well drilling rigs, and two-engine cranes. Such vehicles are used in construction, mining, and industrial operations. The regulation does not apply to stationary equipment or portable equipment such as generators. The off-road vehicle regulation establishes emissions performance requirements, reporting, disclosure, and labeling requirements for off-road vehicles, and limits unnecessary idling. 
California Building Code 
The California Building Code (CBC) contains standards that regulate the method of use, properties, performance, or types of materials used in the construction, alteration, improvement, repair, or rehabilitation 
Air Quality & Greenhouse Gas Impact Assessment  AMBIENT Air Quality & Noise Consulting  
Willemsen Addition to River View Park Project  May 2023  
8  

of a building or other improvement to real property. The CBC is adopted every three years by the Building Standards Commission (BSC). In the interim, the BSC also adopts annual updates to make necessary mid­term corrections. The CBC standards apply statewide; however, a local jurisdiction may amend a CBC standard if it makes a finding that the amendment is reasonably necessary due to local climatic, geological, or topographical conditions. 
Green Building Standards 
In essence, green buildings standards are indistinguishable from any other building standards. Both standards are contained in the CBC and regulate the construction of new buildings and improvements. The only practical distinction between the two is that whereas the focus of traditional building standards has been protecting public health and safety, the focus of green building standards is to improve environmental performance. 
Local 
Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District 
The SBCAPCD is the agency primarily responsible for ensuring that NAAQS and CAAQS are not exceeded and that air quality conditions within the region are maintained. Responsibilities of the SBCAPCD include, but are not limited to, preparing plans for the attainment of ambient air quality standards, adopting and enforcing rules and regulations concerning sources of air pollution, issuing permits for stationary sources of air pollution, inspecting stationary sources of air pollution and responding to citizen complaints, monitoring ambient air quality and meteorological conditions, and implementing programs and regulations required by the FCAA and the CCAA. 
Impact Analysis 
Thresholds of Significance 
In accordance with Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, air quality impacts associated with the proposed project would be considered significant if it would: 
a) 
Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan. 

b) 
Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard. 

c) 
Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations. 

d) 
Result in other emissions (such as those leading to odors) adversely affecting a substantial number of people. 


To assist in the evaluation of air quality impacts, the SBCAPCD has developed recommended significance thresholds, which are contained in the SBCAPCD Scope and Content of Air Quality Sections in Environmental Documents (SBCAPCD 2017). For the purposes of this analysis, project emissions are considered potentially significant impacts if any of the following SBCAPCD recommended thresholds are exceeded: 
Construction Impacts 
The SBCAPCD recommends 25 tons per year for reactive organic compounds (ROC) or NOX as a guideline for determining the significance of construction impacts. In addition, the SBCAPCD recommends incorporation of standard mitigation measures to minimize localized air quality impacts commonly associated with construction activities and to ensure consistency with air quality attainment and maintenance efforts. 
Operational Impacts 
A proposed project will have a significant impact on air quality, either individually or cumulatively, if operational emissions would: 
Air Quality & Greenhouse Gas Impact Assessment  AMBIENT Air Quality & Noise Consulting  
Willemsen Addition to River View Park Project  May 2023  
9  

• 
exceed the daily trigger for offsets or Air Quality Impact Analysis set in the SBCAPCD New Source Review Rule, for any pollutant (i.e., 240 pounds/day for ROC or NOx; and 80 lbs/day for PM10). There is no daily operational threshold for CO (it is an attainment pollutant) 

• 
exceed 25 pounds/day of NOx or ROC from motor vehicle trips only 

• 
would cause or contribute to a violation of any CAAQS or NAAQS (except O3) 

• 
would exceed the SBCAPCD health risk public notification thresholds adopted by the SBCAPCD Board (10 excess cancer cases in a million for cancer risk and a Hazard Index of more than one (1.0) for non-cancer risk) 

• 
would be inconsistent with the latest adopted federal and state air quality plans for Santa Barbara County. 


Methodology 
Short-term emissions associated with the construction of the proposed project were calculated using the California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod), version 2020.4.0, computer program. Construction emissions were calculated assuming an estimated overall construction period of nine months, based on construction information provided. Project-specific construction information, such as activity schedules, equipment use, worker vehicle trips, and equipment load factors were not available and, therefore, were based on model defaults for Santa Barbara County. Demolition of existing structures is not anticipated to be required, however, some minor demolition may be required during renovation of the existing structures. Modeling assumptions and output files are included in Appendix A of this report. 
Long-term operational increases in emissions of criteria air pollutants were calculated using the CalEEMod, version 2020.4.0. Emissions modeling included quantification of emissions associated with area sources, energy use, and mobile sources. Area sources included the use of architectural coatings and landscape maintenance activities. Energy use included emissions associated with natural gas and electricity use. Trip-generation rates were obtained from the traffic analysis prepared for the proposed project (ATE 2023). Specific fleet-mix data for the project was not available and, therefore, were based on the default fleet mix identified in CalEEMod for Santa Barbara County. 
Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures 
Impact AQ-A. Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan. 
SBCAPCD 2019 Ozone Plan 
As part of the CCAA, the SBCAPCD is required to develop a plan to achieve and maintain the state ozone standard by the earliest practicable date. The SBCAPCD 2019 Ozone Plan (Plan) addresses the attainment and maintenance of state and federal ambient air quality standards. The Plan was adopted by SBCAPCD on December 19, 2019 (SBCAPCD 2019). 
The Plan outlines the SBCAPCD strategies to reduce ozone-precursor pollutants (i.e., ROC and NOX) from a wide variety of sources. The Plan includes a stationary-source control program, which includes control measures for permitted stationary sources; as well as, transportation and land use management strategies to reduce motor vehicle emissions. The stationary-source control program is administered by SBCAPCD. Transportation and land use control measures are implemented at the local or regional level, by promoting and facilitating the use of alternative transportation options, increased pedestrian access and accessibility to community services and local destinations, reductions in vehicle miles traveled, and promotion of congestion management efforts. In addition, local jurisdictions also prepare population forecasts, which are used by SBCAPCD to forecast population-related emissions and air quality attainment, including those contained in the Plan. 
Consistency with land use and population forecasts in local and regional plans, including the Plan, is required for projects subject to CEQA. Proposed projects subject to the most recent Plan consistency determinations include but are not limited to commercial, industrial, residential, and transportation projects. The Plan relies primarily on the land use and population projections provided by the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG) and ARB on-road emissions forecast as a basis for vehicle emission forecasting. The Plan uses SBCAG’s countywide regional transportation demand model for on-road mobile source emissions estimates and SBCAG’s socio-economic projections to form the basis for some stationary and area source growth forecasts.

To be consistent with the standard dust mitigation measures in Section 6.1 of the SBCAPCD Scope and Content of Air Quality Sections in Environmental Documents (based on policies adopted in the 1979 Air Quality Attainment Plan [AQAP]), all projects involving earthmoving activities must implement the standard dust control measures. implementation of standard dust control measures would be required as stated in Impact AQ-B and detailed in Mitigation Measure AQ-1. 
The proposed project would not result in an increase in population or employment that would affect regional emissions analyses. In addition, based on the traffic analysis prepared for this project, the project would have a less than significant impact on vehicle miles traveled. As a result, the proposed project would not be anticipated to adversely impact regional emissions forecasts nor interfere with regional air quality attainment and maintenance efforts. This impact is considered less than significant. 
Impact AQ-B. Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard. 
Short-term Construction Emissions 
Construction-generated emissions are of temporary duration, lasting only as long as construction activities occur, but have the potential to represent a significant air quality impact. Construction of the proposed project would result in the temporary generation of emissions associated with paving, architectural coating application, motor vehicle exhaust associated with construction equipment and worker trips, as well as the movement of construction equipment on unpaved surfaces. Short-term construction emissions would result in increased emissions of ozone-precursor pollutants (i.e., reactive organic gases (ROG) and NOX) and emissions of PM. 
Estimated maximum annual emissions associated with construction of the proposed project are presented in Table AQ-3. As depicted in Table AQ-3, the maximum annual construction-generated emissions would total approximately 0.02 tons/year of ROG and 1.5 tons/year of NOx. Maximum annual construction emissions would not exceed the threshold of 25 tons/year. However, since Santa Barbara County violates the state standard for PM10, dust control measures are required for all projects involved in earthmoving activities regardless of the significance of the fugitive dust impacts. In addition, as discussed in Impact AQ-C, emissions of PM10 can result in nuisance impacts, including irritation of eyes and respiratory tract (refer to Table AQ-1). For these reasons, construction-generated emissions would be considered to have a potentially significant impact.

Dust Control Measures 
a. 
During construction, use water trucks or sprinkler systems to keep all areas of vehicle movement damp enough to prevent dust from leaving the site. At a minimum, this should include wetting down such areas in the late morning and after work is completed for the day. Increased watering frequency should be required whenever the wind speed exceeds 15 miles per hour. Reclaimed water should be used whenever feasible. However, reclaimed water should not be used in or around crops for human consumption. 

b. 
Minimize amount of disturbed area and reduce on site vehicle speeds to 15 miles per hour or less. 

c. 
If importation, exportation and stockpiling of fill material is involved, soil stockpiled for more than two days shall be covered, kept moist, or treated with soil binders to prevent dust generation. Trucks transporting fill material to and from the site shall be tarped from the point of origin. 

d. 
Gravel pads shall be installed at all access points to prevent tracking of mud onto public roads. 

e. 
After clearing, grading, earth moving or excavation is completed, treat the disturbed area by watering, or revegetating, or by spreading soil binders until the area is paved or otherwise developed so that dust generation will not occur.

Significance After Mitigation 
Mitigation Measure AQ-1 would require implementation of dust-control measures for ground-disturbing activities, as well as, measures for the control of construction equipment emissions, including emissions of diesel particulate matter. Implementation of PM emission measures would reduce emissions of fugitive dust by approximately 50 percent, or more. In addition, the project would be required to comply with SBCAPCD’s Rule 345 for the control of fugitive dust associated with construction and demolition activities. Asphalt paving activities would also be required to comply with SBCAPCD’s Rule 329 for the use of cutback and emulsified asphalt paving materials, which would help to further reduce emissions of ROG. With mitigation and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, this impact would be considered less than significant.

Long-term Operational Emissions 
Long-term operational emissions associated with the proposed project would be predominantly associated with mobile sources. To a lesser extent, emissions associated with area sources, such as landscape maintenance activities, as well as, use of electricity and natural gas would also contribute to increased operational emissions. 
Operational emissions are depicted in Table AQ-4. As depicted in Table AQ-4, daily operational emissions would total approximately 1.1 pounds/day of ROG, 0.8 pounds/day of NOx, and 0.3 pounds/day of PM10. Estimated daily operational emissions from all sources of ROG, NOX, and PM10 would not exceed the SBCAPCD operational thresholds of 240 pounds/day for ROC or NOx; and 80 pounds/day for PM10. As a result, this impact would be considered less than significant.

Impact AQ-C. Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations. 
As previously noted in Impact AQ-B, the proposed project is not anticipated to result in substantial ground disturbance, such as grading or site preparation activities. However, in the event that ground-disturbance were to occur, SBCAPCD-recommended mitigation measures would be required for the control of fugitive dust. In addition, the project would be required to comply with SBCAPCD’s Rule 345 for the control of fugitive dust associated with construction and demolition activities. Other potential sources of localized pollutants are discussed in greater detail, as follows: 
Naturally-Occurring Asbestos 
The ARB identifies naturally-occurring asbestos (NOA) as a toxic air contaminant (TAC). In accordance with ARB Air Toxics Control Measure, prior to any grading activities, a geologic evaluation should be conducted to determine if NOA is present within the area that will be disturbed. If NOA is not present, an exemption request form, along with a copy of the geologic report, must be filed with the local air district. If NOA is found at the site, the applicant must comply with all requirements outlined in the Asbestos Air Toxics Control Measure. The project site is not located within an area identified as having a potential for naturally-occurring ultramafic rock and serpentine soils. As a result, this impact would be considered less than significant.

Asbestos-Containing Materials 
Demolition activities can have potential negative air quality impacts, including issues surrounding the proper handling, demolition, and disposal of asbestos-containing materials (ACM). ACM could be encountered during the renovation of existing buildings, particularly older structures constructed prior to 1970. Asbestos can also be found in various building products, including (but not limited to) utility pipes/pipelines (transit pipes or insulation on pipes). The proposed project would require the renovation of existing structures, which could result in the disturbance of ACM. As a result, this impact would be considered potentially significant. 
Lead-Coated Materials 
The renovation/demolition of structures with materials coated with lead-based paint can have potential negative air quality impacts and may adversely affect the health of nearby individuals. Improper handling of lead-containing materials can result in the release of lead-containing particles from the site. The proposed project would require the renovation of existing structures, which could result in the disturbance of lead-containing materials. As a result, this impact would be considered potentially significant. 
Localized PM Concentrations 
Fugitive dust emissions would be primarily associated with building demolition, site preparation, grading, and vehicle travel on unpaved and paved surfaces. On-site off-road equipment and trucks would also result in short-term emissions of diesel-exhaust PM, which could contribute to elevated localized concentration at nearby receptors. Uncontrolled emissions of fugitive dust may also contribute to potential increases in nuisance impacts to nearby receptors. For these reasons, localized uncontrolled concentrations of construction-generated PM would be considered to have a potentially significant impact. 
Localized Carbon Monoxide Concentrations 
Localized concentrations of CO are of primary concern in areas located near congested roadway intersections. Of particular concern are signalized intersections that are projected to operate at unacceptable levels of service (LOS) (LOS E or LOS F). The proposed project is considered a “small project” and would not have an adverse local or regional traffic impact (ATE 2023). For this reason and given the low ambient concentrations in the project area and that the area is current designated attainment for CO, implementation of the proposed project is not anticipated to contribute to localized mobile-source CO concentrations that would exceed applicable ambient air quality standards. This impact is considered less than significant. 
Toxic Air Contaminants 
If a project has the potential to emit toxic air contaminants (TACs) or is located in close proximity to sensitive receptors, long-term impacts may be considered significant due to increased cancer risk for the affected population. The proposed project is not expected to include the installation of stationary sources of TACs. As a result, this impact would be considered less than significant. 
Mitigation Measures 
AQ-2: To reduce potential exposure to localized pollutant concentrations associated with construction activities, Mitigation Measure AQ-1 and the following additional measure shall be implemented: 
• Demolition of on-site structures shall comply with the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Emissions requirements (NESHAP, 40 CFR, Part 61, Subpart M) for the demolition of existing structures. The SBCAPCD is delegated authority by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement the Federal NESHAP requirements, including requirements pertaining to the handling of asbestos-containing material and lead-based paint. Prior to demolition of on-site structures, the SBCAPCD shall be notified, per NESHAP requirements. Additional information may be obtained at SBCAPCD’s website, URL: https://www.ourair.org/asbestos/.

Significance After Mitigation 
Mitigation Measure AQ-1 would require implementation of dust-control measures for ground-disturbing activities, as well as, measures for the control of construction equipment emissions, including emissions of diesel particulate matter. Implementation of PM emission measures would reduce emissions of fugitive dust by approximately 50 percent, or more. In addition, demolition activities would be required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements for the handling of hazardous materials, including federal NESHAP requirements. With mitigation and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, this impact would be considered less than significant. 
Impact AQ-D. Result in other emissions (such as those leading to odors) adversely affecting a substantial number of people. 
The occurrence and severity of odor impacts depend on numerous factors, including the nature, frequency, and intensity of the source; wind speed and direction; and the sensitivity of the receptors. While offensive odors rarely cause any physical harm, they still can be very unpleasant, leading to considerable distress among the public and often generating citizen complaints to local governments and regulatory agencies. Projects with the potential to frequently expose members of the public to objectionable odors would be deemed to have a significant impact. 
The proposed project would not result in the installation of any equipment or processes that would be considered major odor-emission sources. However, construction of the proposed project would involve the use of a variety of gasoline or diesel-powered equipment that would emit exhaust fumes. Exhaust fumes, particularly diesel-exhaust, may be considered objectionable by some people. In addition, pavement coatings and architectural coatings used during project construction would also emit temporary odors. However, construction-generated emissions would occur intermittently throughout the workday and would dissipate rapidly with increasing distance from the source. In addition, the project would be required to comply with SBCAPCD Rule 303 that prohibits the discharge of air contaminants or other material that would cause injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of persons. As a result, short-term construction activities would not expose a substantial number of people to frequent odorous emissions. For these reasons, potential exposure of sensitive receptors to odorous emissions would be considered less than significant.

GREENHOUSE GASES AND CLIMATE CHANGE 
Existing Setting 
To fully understand global climate change, it is important to recognize the naturally occurring “greenhouse effect” and to define the greenhouse gases (GHGs) that contribute to this phenomenon. Various gases in the earth’s atmosphere, classified as atmospheric GHGs, play a critical role in determining the earth’s surface temperature. Solar radiation enters the earth’s atmosphere from space and a portion of the radiation is absorbed by the earth’s surface. The earth emits this radiation back toward space, but the properties of the radiation change from high-frequency solar radiation to lower-frequency infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases, which are transparent to solar radiation, are effective in absorbing infrared radiation. As a result, this radiation that otherwise would have escaped back into space is now retained, resulting in a warming of the atmosphere. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect. Among the prominent GHGs contributing to the greenhouse effect are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Primary GHGs attributed to global climate change, are discussed, as follows: 
• 
Carbon Dioxide. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless gas. CO2 is emitted in a number of ways, both naturally and through human activities. The largest source of CO2 emissions globally is the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas in power plants, automobiles, industrial facilities, and other sources. A number of specialized industrial production processes and product uses such as mineral production, metal production, and the use of petroleum-based products can also lead to CO2 emissions. The atmospheric lifetime of CO2 is variable because it is so readily exchanged in the atmosphere (U.S. EPA 2018). 

• 
Methane. Methane (CH4) is a colorless, odorless gas that is not flammable under most circumstances. CH4 is the major component of natural gas, about 87 percent by volume. It is also formed and released to the atmosphere by biological processes occurring in anaerobic environments. Methane is emitted from a variety of both human-related and natural sources. Human-related sources include fossil fuel production, animal husbandry (enteric fermentation in livestock and manure management), rice cultivation, biomass burning, and waste management. These activities release significant quantities of methane to the atmosphere. Natural sources of methane include wetlands, gas hydrates, permafrost, termites, oceans, freshwater bodies, non-wetland soils, and other sources 


such as wildfires. Methane’s atmospheric lifetime is about 12 years (U.S. EPA 2018). 
• 
Nitrous Oxide. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a clear, colorless gas with a slightly sweet odor. N2O is produced by both natural and human-related sources. Primary human-related sources of N2O are agricultural soil management, animal manure management, sewage treatment, mobile and stationary combustion of fossil fuels, acid production, and nitric acid production. N2O is also produced naturally from a wide variety of biological sources in soil and water, particularly microbial action in wet tropical forests. The atmospheric lifetime of N2O is approximately 114 years (U.S. EPA 2018). 

• 
Hydrofluorocarbons. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are man-made chemicals, many of which have been developed as alternatives to ozone-depleting substances for industrial, commercial, and consumer products. The only significant emissions of HFCs before 1990 were of the chemical HFC-23, which is generated as a byproduct of the production of HCFC-22 (or Freon 22, used in air conditioning applications). The atmospheric lifetime for HFCs varies from just over a year for HFC­152a to 270 years for HFC-23. Most of the commercially used HFCs have atmospheric lifetimes of less than 15 years (e.g., HFC-134a, which is used in automobile air conditioning and refrigeration, has an atmospheric life of 14 years) (U.S. EPA 2018). 

• 
Perfluorocarbons. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are colorless, highly dense, chemically inert, and non­toxic. There are seven PFC gases: perfluoromethane (CF4), perfluoroethane (C2F6), perfluoropropane (C3F8), perfluorobutane (C4F10), perfluorocyclobutane (C4F8), perfluoropentane (C5F12), and perfluorohexane (C6F14). Natural geological emissions have been responsible for the PFCs that have accumulated in the atmosphere in the past; however, the largest current source is aluminum production, which releases CF4 and C2F6 as byproducts. The estimated atmospheric lifetimes for PFCs ranges from 2,600 to 50,000 years (U.S. EPA 2018). 

• 
Nitrogen Trifluoride. Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) is an inorganic, colorless, odorless, toxic, nonflammable gas used as an etchant in microelectronics. NF3 is predominantly employed in the cleaning of the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition chambers in the production of liquid crystal displays and silicon-based thin-film solar cells. It has a global warming potential of 16,100 carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). While NF3 may have a lower global warming potential than other chemical etchants, it is still a potent GHG. In 2009, NF3 was listed by California as a high global warming potential GHG to be listed and regulated under AB 32 (Section 38505 Health and Safety Code). 

• 
Sulfur Hexafluoride. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is an inorganic compound that is colorless, odorless, non­toxic, and generally non-flammable. SF6 is primarily used as an electrical insulator in high voltage equipment. The electric power industry uses roughly 80 percent of all SF6 produced worldwide. Leaks of SF6 occur from aging equipment and during equipment maintenance and servicing. SF6 has an atmospheric life of 3,200 years (U.S. EPA 2018). 

• 
Black Carbon. Black carbon is the strongest light-absorbing component of PM emitted from burning fuels such as coal, diesel, and biomass. Black carbon contributes to climate change both directly by absorbing sunlight and indirectly by depositing on snow and by interacting with clouds and affecting cloud formation. Black carbon is considered a short-lived species, which can vary spatially and, consequently, it is very difficult to quantify associated global-warming potentials. The main sources of black carbon in California are wildfires, off-road vehicles (locomotives, marine vessels, tractors, excavators, dozers, etc.), on-road vehicles (cars, trucks, and buses), fireplaces, agricultural waste burning, and prescribed burning (planned burns of forest or wildlands) (CCAC 2018, U.S. EPA 2018).

Each GHG differs in its ability to absorb heat in the atmosphere based on the lifetime, or persistence, of the gas molecule in the atmosphere. Often, estimates of GHG emissions are presented in CO2e, which weight each gas by its global warming potential (GWP). Expressing GHG emissions in CO2e takes the contribution of all GHG emissions to the greenhouse effect and converts them to a single unit equivalent to the effect that would occur if only CO2 were being emitted. Table GHG-1 provides a summary of the GWP for GHG emissions of typical concern with regard to community development projects, based on a 100-year time horizon. As indicated, CH4 traps over 25 times more heat per molecule than CO2, and N2O absorbs roughly 298 times more heat per molecule than CO2. Additional GHG with high GWP includes NF3, SF6, PFCs, and black carbon.

Statewide GHG Emissions 
In 2020, GHG emissions within California totaled 369.2 million metric tons (MMT) of CO2e. GHG emissions, by sector, are summarized in Figure GHG-1. Within California, the transportation sector is the largest contributor, accounting for approximately 38 percent of the total state-wide GHG emissions. Emissions associated with industrial uses are the second-largest contributor, totaling roughly 23 percent. Electricity generation totaled roughly 16 percent. Other major emission sources included commercial uses, residential uses, agriculture, recycling, and waste (ARB 2023).

Short-Lived Climate Pollutants 
Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), such as black carbon, fluorinated gases, and CH4 also have a dramatic effect on climate change. Though short-lived, these pollutants create a warming influence on the climate that is many times more potent than that of carbon dioxide. 
As part of the ARB’s efforts to address SLCPs, the ARB has developed a statewide emission inventory for black 
carbon. The black carbon inventory will help support the implementation of the SLCP Strategy, but it is not 
part of the State’s GHG Inventory that tracks progress towards the State’s climate targets. The most recent 
inventory for year 2013 conditions is depicted in Figure GHG-2. As depicted, off-road mobile sources account for a majority of black carbon emissions totaling roughly 36 percent of the inventory. Other major anthropogenic sources of black carbon include on-road transportation, residential wood burning, fuel combustion, and industrial processes (ARB 2022).

Effects of Global Climate Change 
There are uncertainties as to exactly what the climate changes will be in various local areas of the earth. There are also uncertainties associated with the magnitude and timing of other consequences of a warmer planet: sea-level rise, spread of certain diseases out of their usual geographic range, the effect on agricultural production, water supply, sustainability of ecosystems, increased strength and frequency of storms, extreme heat events, increased air pollution episodes, and the consequence of these effects on the economy. 
Within California, climate changes would likely alter the ecological characteristics of many ecosystems throughout the state. Such alterations would likely include increases in surface temperatures and changes in the form, timing, and intensity of the precipitation. For instance, historical records are depicting an increasing trend toward earlier snowmelt in the Sierra Nevada. This snowpack is a principal supply of water for the state, providing roughly 50 percent of the state’s annual runoff. If this trend continues, some areas of the state may experience an increased danger of floods during the winter months and possible exhaustion of the snowpack during spring and summer months. Earlier snowmelt would also impact the State’s energy resources. Currently, approximately 20 percent of California's electricity comes from hydropower. Early exhaustion of the Sierra snowpack may force electricity producers to switch to more costly or non-renewable forms of electricity generation during the spring and summer months. A changing climate may also impact agricultural crop yields, coastal structures, and biodiversity. As a result, resultant changes in climate will likely 
have detrimental effects on some of California’s largest industries, including agriculture, wine, tourism, skiing, 
recreational and commercial fishing, and forestry. 
Regulatory Framework 
Federal 
Executive Order 13514 
Executive Order 13514 is focused on reducing GHGs internally in federal agency missions, programs, and operations. In addition, the executive order directs federal agencies to participate in the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force, which is engaged in developing a national strategy for adaptation to climate change. 
On April 2, 2007, in Massachusetts v. U.S. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, the Supreme Court found that GHGs are air pollutants covered by the FCAA and that the U.S. EPA has the authority to regulate GHG. The Court held that the U.S. EPA Administrator must determine whether or not emissions of GHGs from new motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, or whether the science is too uncertain to make a reasoned decision. 
On December 7, 2009, the U.S. EPA Administrator signed two distinct findings regarding GHGs under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act: 
• 
Endangerment Finding: The Administrator found that the current and projected concentrations of the six key well-mixed GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6) in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations. 

• 
Cause or Contribute Finding: The Administrator found that the combined emissions of these well-mixed GHGs from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to the GHG pollution which threatens public health and welfare. 


Although these findings did not themselves impose any requirements on industry or other entities, this action was a prerequisite to finalizing the U.S. EPA’s Proposed Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for Light-Duty Vehicles, which was published on September 15, 2009. On May 7, 2010, the final Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards were published in the Federal Register. 
The U.S. EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are taking coordinated steps to enable the production of a new generation of clean vehicles with reduced GHG emissions and improved 
Air Quality & Greenhouse Gas Impact Assessment  AMBIENT Air Quality & Noise Consulting

fuel efficiency from on-road vehicles and engines. These next steps include developing the first-ever GHG regulations for heavy-duty engines and vehicles, as well as additional light-duty vehicle GHG regulations. These steps were outlined by President Obama in a Presidential Memorandum on May 21, 2010. 
The final combined U.S. EPA and NHTSA standards that make up the first phase of this national program apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles, covering model years 2012 through 2016. The standards require these vehicles to meet an estimated combined average emissions level of 250 grams of CO2 per mile (the equivalent to 35.5 miles per gallon if the automobile industry were to meet this CO2 level solely through fuel economy improvements). Together, these standards will cut GHG emissions by an estimated 960 MMT and 1.8 billion barrels of oil over the lifetime of the vehicles sold under the program (model years 2012-2016). On August 28, 2012, U.S. EPA and NHTSA issued their joint rule to extend this national program of coordinated GHG and fuel economy standards to model years 2017 through 2025 passenger vehicles. 
State 
Assembly Bill 1493 
AB 1493 (Pavley) of 2002 (Health and Safety Code Sections 42823 and 43018.5) requires the ARB to develop and adopt the nation’s first GHG emission standards for automobiles. These standards are also known as Pavley I. The California Legislature declared in AB 1493 that global warming is a matter of increasing concern for public health and the environment. It cites several risks that California faces from climate change, 
including a reduction in the state’s water supply; an increase in air pollution caused by higher temperatures; 
harm to agriculture; an increase in wildfires; damage to the coastline; and economic losses caused by higher food, water, energy, and insurance prices. The bill also states that technological solutions to reduce GHG 
emissions would stimulate California’s economy and provide jobs. In 2004, the State of California submitted 
a request for a waiver from federal clean air regulations, as the State is authorized to do under the FCAA, to allow the State to require reduced tailpipe emissions of CO2. In late 2007, the U.S. EPA denied California’s waiver request and declined to promulgate adequate federal regulations limiting GHG emissions. In early 2008, the State brought suit against the U.S. EPA related to this denial. 
In January 2009, President Obama instructed the U.S. EPA to reconsider the Bush Administration’s denial of California’s and 13 other states’ requests to implement global warming pollution standards for cars and trucks. In June 2009, the U.S. EPA granted California’s waiver request, enabling the State to enforce its GHG 
emissions standards for new motor vehicles beginning with the current model year. 
In 2009, President Obama announced a national policy aimed at both increasing fuel economy and reducing GHG pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in the US. The new standards would cover model years 2012 to 2016 and would raise passenger vehicle fuel economy to a fleet average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. When the national program takes effect, California has committed to allowing automakers who show compliance with the national program to also be deemed in compliance with state requirements. California is committed to further strengthening these standards beginning in 2017 to obtain a 45 percent GHG reduction from the 2020 model year vehicles. 
Executive Order S-3-05 
Executive Order S-3-05 (State of California) proclaims that California is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It declares that increased temperatures could reduce the Sierra’s snowpack, further exacerbate California’s air quality problems, and potentially cause a rise in sea levels. To combat those concerns, the 
Executive Order established total GHG emission targets. Specifically, emissions are to be reduced to the 2000 level by 2010, to the 1990 level by 2020, and to 80 percent below the 1990 level by 2050. 
The Executive Order directed the secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) to coordinate a multi-agency effort to reduce GHG emissions to the target levels. The secretary will also submit biannual reports to the governor and state legislature describing (1) progress made toward reaching the emission targets, (2) impacts of global warming on California’s resources, and (3) mitigation and adaptation plans to combat these impacts. To comply with the Executive Order, the secretary of CalEPA created a Climate Action Team made up of members from various state agencies and commissions. The Climate Action Team released its first report in March 2006 and continues to release periodic reports on progress. The report proposed to achieve the targets by building on voluntary actions of California businesses, local government, and community actions, as well as through state incentive and regulatory programs.

Executive Order B-30-15 
In 2015, Governor Brown signed Executive Order B-30-15, which establishes a California GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. 
Executive Order B-55-18 
In 2018, Governor Brown signed Executive Order B-55-18, which set a target of statewide carbon neutrality by 2045. 
Executive Order N-79-20 
In 2020, Governor Newsom signed Executive Order N-79-20, which calls for elimination of new internal combustion passenger vehicles by 2035. It would end sales of internal combustion passenger vehicles by 2035. It is important to note that the Executive Order focuses on new vehicle sales for automakers, and therefore does not require Californians to give up the existing cars and trucks they already own. 
Climate Change Scoping Plan 
In October 2008, ARB published its Climate Change Proposed Scoping Plan, which is the State’s plan to 
achieve GHG reductions in California required by AB 32. This initial Scoping Plan contained the main strategies to be implemented in order to achieve the target emission levels identified in AB 32. The Scoping Plan included ARB-recommended GHG reductions for each emissions sector of the state’s GHG inventory. The largest proposed GHG reduction recommendations were associated with improving emissions standards for light-duty vehicles, implementing the Low Carbon Fuel Standard program, implementation of energy efficiency measures in buildings and appliances, and the widespread development of combined heat and power systems, and developing a renewable portfolio standard for electricity production. 
The Scoping Plan states that land use planning and urban growth decisions will play important roles in the 
state’s GHG reductions because local governments have primary authority to plan, zone, approve, and 
permit how land is developed to accommodate population growth and the changing needs of their jurisdictions. ARB further acknowledges that decisions on how land is used will have large impacts on the GHG emissions that will result from the transportation, housing, industry, forestry, water, agriculture, electricity, and natural gas emissions sectors. With regard to land use planning, the Scoping Plan expects approximately 
5.0 MMT CO2e will be achieved associated with the implementation of Senate Bill (SB) 375, which is discussed further below. 
The initial Scoping Plan was first approved by ARB on December 11, 2008, and is updated every five years. The first update of the Scoping Plan was approved by the ARB on May 22, 2014, which looked past 2020 to set mid-term goals (2030-2035) on the road to reaching the 2050 goals., The most recent update released by ARB is the 2022 Climate Change Scoping Plan. The 2022 Climate Change Scoping Plan lays out a path to achieve targets for carbon neutrality and reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions by 85 percent below 1990 levels no later than 2045. The actions and outcomes in the plan will achieve significant reductions in fossil fuel combustion by deploying clean technologies and fuels, further reductions in short-lived climate pollutants, support for sustainable development, increased action on natural and working lands to reduce emissions and sequester carbon, and the capture and storage of carbon (ARB 2023). 
Mandatory Reporting of GHG Emissions 
The California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32, 2006) requires the reporting of GHGs by major sources to the ARB. Major sources required to report GHG emissions include industrial facilities, suppliers of transportation fuels, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied petroleum gas, and carbon dioxide, operators of petroleum and natural gas systems, and electricity retail providers and marketers.

Cap-and-Trade Regulation 
The cap-and-trade regulation is a key element in California’s climate plan. It sets a statewide limit on sources responsible for 85 percent of California’s GHG emissions and establishes a price signal needed to drive long­term investment in cleaner fuels and more efficient use of energy. The cap-and-trade rules came into effect on January 1, 2013, and apply to large electric power plants and large industrial plants. In 2015, fuel distributors, including distributors of heating and transportation fuels, also became subject to the cap-and­trade rules. At that stage, the program will encompass around 360 businesses throughout California and 
nearly 85 percent of the state’s total GHG emissions. 
Under the cap-and-trade regulation, companies must hold enough emission allowances to cover their emissions and are free to buy and sell allowances on the open market. California held its first auction of GHG allowances on November 14, 2012. California’s GHG cap-and-trade system is projected to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 and would achieve an approximate 80 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2050. 
Senate Bill 32 
SB 32 was signed by Governor Brown on September 8, 2016. SB 32 effectively extends California’s GHG emission-reduction goals from year 2020 to year 2030. This new emission-reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 is intended to promote further GHG-reductions in support of the State’s ultimate goal of reducing GHG emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. SB 32 also directs the ARB to update the Climate Change Scoping Plan to address this interim 2030 emission-reduction target. 
Senate Bill 97 
SB 97 was enacted in 2007. SB 97 required the Office of Planning and Research to develop, and the Natural Resources Agency to adopt, amendments to the CEQA Guidelines addressing the analysis and mitigation of GHG emissions. Those CEQA Guidelines amendments clarified several points, including the following: 
• 
Lead agencies must analyze the GHG emissions of proposed projects and must reach a conclusion regarding the significance of those emissions. 

• 
When a project’s GHG emissions may be significant, lead agencies must consider a range of 


potential mitigation measures to reduce those emissions. 
• 
Lead agencies must analyze potentially significant impacts associated with placing projects in hazardous locations, including locations potentially affected by climate change. 

• 
Lead agencies may significantly streamline the analysis of GHGs on a project level by using a programmatic GHG emissions reduction plan meeting certain criteria. 

• 
CEQA mandates analysis of a proposed project’s potential energy use (including transportation-related energy), sources of energy supply and ways to reduce energy demand, including through the use of efficient transportation alternatives. 


As part of the administrative rulemaking process, the California Natural Resources Agency developed a Final Statement of Reasons explaining the legal and factual bases, intent, and purpose of the CEQA Guidelines amendments. The amendments to the CEQA Guidelines implementing SB 97 became effective on March 18, 2010. 
Senate Bill 100 
SB 100 was signed by Governor Jerry Brown on September 10, 2018. SB 100 sets a goal of phasing out all fossil 
fuels from the state’s electricity sector by 2045. SB 100 increases to 60 percent, from 50 percent, how much of California’s electricity portfolio must come from renewables by 2030. It establishes a further goal to have 
an electric grid that is entirely powered by clean energy by 2045, which could include other carbon-free sources, like nuclear power, that are not renewable. 
Senate Bill 375 
SB 375 requires Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to adopt a sustainable communities strategy (SCS) or alternative planning strategy (APS) that will address land-use allocation in that MPOs regional 
Air Quality & Greenhouse Gas Impact Assessment  AMBIENT Air Quality & Noise Consulting  
Willemsen Addition to River View Park Project  May 2023

transportation plan. ARB, in consultation with MPOs, establishes regional reduction targets for GHGs emitted by passenger cars and light trucks for the years 2020 and 2035. These reduction targets will be updated every eight years but can be updated every four years if advancements in emissions technologies affect the reduction strategies to achieve the targets. ARB is also charged with reviewing each MPO’s SCS or APS for consistency with its assigned targets. If MPOs do not meet the GHG reduction targets, funding for transportation projects may be withheld. In 2018, ARB adopted updated SB 375 targets. 
California Building Code 
The CBC contains standards that regulate the method of use, properties, performance, or types of materials used in the construction, alteration, improvement, repair, or rehabilitation of a building or other improvement to real property. The CBC is adopted every three years by the BSC. In the interim, the BSC also adopts annual updates to make necessary mid-term corrections. The CBC standards apply statewide; however, a local jurisdiction may amend a CBC standard if it makes a finding that the amendment is reasonably necessary due to local climatic, geological, or topographical conditions. 
Green Building Standards 
In essence, green buildings standards are indistinguishable from any other building standards. Both standards are contained in the CBC and regulate the construction of new buildings and improvements. The only practical distinction between the two is that whereas the focus of traditional building standards has been protecting public health and safety, the focus of green building standards is to improve environmental performance. 
Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Strategy 
In March 2017, the ARB adopted the Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Strategy (SLCP Strategy) establishing a path to decrease GHG emissions and displace fossil-based natural gas use. Strategies include avoiding landfill methane emissions by reducing the disposal of organics through edible food recovery, composting, in-vessel digestion, and other processes; and recovering methane from wastewater treatment facilities, and manure methane at dairies, and using the methane as a renewable source of natural gas to fuel vehicles or generate electricity. The SLCP Strategy also identifies steps to reduce natural gas leaks from oil and gas wells, pipelines, valves, and pumps to improve safety, avoid energy losses, and reduce methane emissions associated with natural gas use. Lastly, the SLCP Strategy also identifies measures that can reduce HFC emissions at national and international levels, in addition to State-level action that includes an incentive program to encourage the use of low-GWP refrigerants, and limitations on the use of high-GWP refrigerants in new refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment (ARB 2022). 
Local 
Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District 
The SBCAPCD is a local public agency with the primary mission of realizing and preserving clean air for all county residents and businesses. Responsibilities of the SBCAPCD include, but are not limited to, preparing plans for the attainment of ambient air quality standards, adopting and enforcing rules and regulations concerning sources of air pollution, issuing permits for stationary sources of air pollution, inspecting stationary sources of air pollution and responding to citizen complaints, monitoring ambient air quality and meteorological conditions, and implementing programs and regulations required by federal and state regulatory requirements. 
City of Buellton 
The City of Buellton has not adopted a qualified greenhouse gas reduction plan pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15183.5(b)(1). Therefore, this analysis does not utilize the tiering and streamlining provisions of CEQA Guidelines Section 15183.5(b)(2) in evaluating the significance of the project’s impacts related to GHG emissions. 
Air Quality & Greenhouse Gas Impact Assessment  AMBIENT Air Quality & Noise Consulting  
Willemsen Addition to River View Park Project  May 2023  
23  

Impact Analysis 
In accordance with Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, increased GHG emissions associated with the implementation of the project would be considered significant if may: 
a) 
Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the environment. 

b) 
Conflict with an applicable plan, policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. 


Threshold of Significance 
Neither the SBCAPCD nor the City of Buellton have adopted GHG thresholds of significance for development projects that are subject to CEQA. However, the County of Santa Barbara has recently developed an interim GHG emissions threshold of significance of 300 MTCO2e per year (Santa Barbara County 2020). Projects that exceed this screening threshold can also be evaluated based on an efficiency GHG emissions threshold based on the project’s estimated service population, if applicable. The County’s interim thresholds are based on SB 32 year 2030 GHG-reduction goals, which take into consideration the emission reduction strategies 
outlined in ARB’s Scoping Plan. Projects that do not exceed the County’s interim thresholds would be 
considered to have a less than significant increase in GHG emissions and would not be expected to interfere with GHG-reduction planning efforts (Santa Barbara County 2020). Given that development within both the County and the City would be subject to compliance with the State’s building standards, land use development projects and associated GHG emissions occurring within the City would be similar to that which would occur within the County. For this reason and for purposes of this analysis, project generated emissions were evaluated solely in comparison to a significance threshold of 300 MTCO2e per year. Project-generated GHG emissions that would exceed 300 MTCO2e/year would be considered to have a potentially significant impact on the environment that could conflict with GHG-reduction planning efforts. 
Methodology 
Short-term Construction Impacts 
Short-term emissions were quantified using the CalEEMod, version 2020.4.0, based on estimated acreages and building square footage for the proposed project. Other modeling assumptions, including construction equipment requirements, hours of use, worker, and vendor vehicle trips, trip distances, and fleet mix were based on model defaults for the County. Construction-generated GHG emissions were amortized over a 30­year period and included with estimated long-term operational GHG emissions for impact assessment purposes. 
Long-term Operational Air Quality Impacts 
Long-term operational GHG emissions were calculated using the CalEEMod, version 2020.4.0. Emissions modeling included quantification of emissions associated with area sources, energy use, and mobile sources. Trip-generation rates for the proposed land uses were derived from the traffic analysis prepared for this project (ATE 2023). Other modeling assumptions, such as vehicle fleet-mix, were not available and, therefore, were based on the default fleet mix identified in CalEEMod for Santa Barbara County. Annual emissions were adjusted based on a total of approximately 12 major events (e.g., weddings) per year (ATE 2023). Emission modeling files are provided in Appendix A.

Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures 
Impact GHG-A. Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the environment; and, 
Impact GHG-B. Conflict with an applicable plan, policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. 
Estimated GHG emissions attributable to future development would be primarily associated with increases of CO2 from mobile sources. To a lesser extent, other GHG pollutants, such as CH4 and N2O, would also be generated. Short-term and long-term GHG emissions associated with the development of the proposed project are discussed in greater detail, as follows: 
Short-term Construction GHG Emissions 
Estimated increases in GHG emissions associated with the construction of the proposed project are summarized in Table GHG-2. Based on the modeling conducted, construction-related GHG emissions would total approximately 222 MTCO2e. Amortized GHG emissions, when averaged over the conservative assumption of 30-year life of the project, would total approximately 7.4 MTCO2e/year. Actual emissions may vary, depending on the final construction schedules, equipment required, and activities conducted. Amortized construction-generated GHG emissions are included in the operational GHG emissions impact discussion provided below.

Amortized Construction Emissions:  7.4  
MTCO2e = Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent Amortized emissions are quantified based on a 30-year project life.  

Long-term Operational GHG Emissions 
Estimated long-term increases in GHG emissions associated with the proposed project are summarized in Table GHG-3. As depicted, operational GHG emissions for the proposed project, with the inclusion of amortized construction GHGs, would total approximately 221.5 MTCO2e/year. A majority of the operational GHG emissions would be associated with energy use and the operation of motor vehicles. To a lesser extent, GHG emissions would also be associated with solid waste generation and water use. Project-generated GHG emissions are projected to decrease in future years due largely to improvements in energy-efficiency and vehicle fleet emission rates. Project-generated operational emissions would not exceed the significance threshold of 300 MTCO2e per year. As a result, the proposed project would not result in increased GHG emissions that would have a significant impact on the environment or conflict with GHG-reduction planning efforts. This impact would be considered less than significant.

Climate Risk Detailed Report 



6.1. Climate Risk Summary 
Cal-Adapt midcentury 2040–2059 average projections for four hazards are reported below for your project location. These are under Representation Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 which assumes GHG emissions will continue to rise strongly through 2050 and then plateau around 2100. 
Climate Hazard  Result for Project Location  Unit  
Temperature and Extreme Heat  10.8  annual days of extreme heat  
Extreme Precipitation  7.20  annual days with precipitation above 20 mm  
Sea Level Rise  0.00  meters of inundation depth  
Wildfire  42.2  annual hectares burned  

Temperature and Extreme Heat data are for grid cell in which your project are located. The projection is based on the 98th historical percentile of daily maximum/minimum temperatures from observed historical data (32 climate model ensemble from Cal-Adapt, 2040–2059 average under RCP 8.5). Each grid cell is 6 kilometers (km) by 6 km, or 3.7 miles (mi) by 3.7 mi. Extreme Precipitation data are for the grid cell in which your project are located. The threshold of 20 mm is equivalent to about ¾ an inch of rain, which would be light to moderate rainfall if received over a full day or heavy rain if received over a period of 2 to 4 hours. Each grid cell is 6 kilometers (km) by 6 km, or 3.7 miles (mi) by 3.7 mi. Sea Level Rise data are for the grid cell in which your project are located. The projections are from Radke et al. (2017), as reported in Cal-Adapt (2040–2059 average under RCP 8.5), and consider different increments of sea level rise coupled with extreme storm events. Users may select from four model simulations to view the range in potential inundation depth for the grid cell. The four simulations make different assumptions about expected rainfall and temperature are: Warmer/drier (HadGEM2-ES), Cooler/wetter (CNRM-CM5), Average conditions (CanESM2), Range of different rainfall and temperature possibilities (MIROC5). Each grid cell is 50 meters (m) by 50 m, or about 164 feet (ft) by 164 ft. 


Wildfire data are for the grid cell in which your project are located. The projections are from UC Davis, as reported in Cal-Adapt (2040–2059 average under RCP 8.5), and consider historical data of climate, vegetation, population density, and large (> 400 ha) fire history. Users may select from four model simulations to view the range in potential wildfire probabilities for the grid cell. The four simulations make different assumptions about expected rainfall and temperature are: Warmer/drier (HadGEM2-ES), Cooler/wetter (CNRM-CM5), Average conditions (CanESM2), Range of different rainfall and temperature possibilities (MIROC5). Each grid cell is 6 kilometers (km) by 6 km, or 3.7 miles (mi) by 3.7 mi.

The sensitivity score reflects the extent to which a project would be adversely affected by exposure to a climate hazard. Exposure is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with a score of 5 representing the greatest exposure. The adaptive capacity of a project refers to its ability to manage and reduce vulnerabilities from projected climate hazards. Adaptive capacity is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with a score of 5 representing the greatest ability to adapt. The overall vulnerability scores are calculated based on the potential impacts and adaptive capacity assessments for each hazard. Scores do not include implementation of climate risk reduction measures.

Climate Risk Detailed Report 



6.1. Climate Risk Summary 
Cal-Adapt midcentury 2040–2059 average projections for four hazards are reported below for your project location. These are under Representation Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 which assumes GHG emissions will continue to rise strongly through 2050 and then plateau around 2100. 
Climate Hazard  Result for Project Location  Unit  
Temperature and Extreme Heat  10.8  annual days of extreme heat  
Extreme Precipitation  7.20  annual days with precipitation above 20 mm  
Sea Level Rise  0.00  meters of inundation depth  
Wildfire  42.2  annual hectares burned  

Temperature and Extreme Heat data are for grid cell in which your project are located. The projection is based on the 98th historical percentile of daily maximum/minimum temperatures from observed historical data (32 climate model ensemble from Cal-Adapt, 2040–2059 average under RCP 8.5). Each grid cell is 6 kilometers (km) by 6 km, or 3.7 miles (mi) by 3.7 mi. Extreme Precipitation data are for the grid cell in which your project are located. The threshold of 20 mm is equivalent to about ¾ an inch of rain, which would be light to moderate rainfall if received over a full day or heavy rain if received over a period of 2 to 4 hours. Each grid cell is 6 kilometers (km) by 6 km, or 3.7 miles (mi) by 3.7 mi. Sea Level Rise data are for the grid cell in which your project are located. The projections are from Radke et al. (2017), as reported in Cal-Adapt (2040–2059 average under RCP 8.5), and consider different increments of sea level rise coupled with extreme storm events. Users may select from four model simulations to view the range in potential inundation depth for the grid cell. The four simulations make different assumptions about expected rainfall and temperature are: Warmer/drier (HadGEM2-ES), Cooler/wetter (CNRM-CM5), Average conditions (CanESM2), Range of different rainfall and temperature possibilities (MIROC5). Each grid cell is 50 meters (m) by 50 m, or about 164 feet (ft) by 164 ft. Wildfire data are for the grid cell in which your project are located. The projections are from UC Davis, as reported in Cal-Adapt (2040–2059 average under RCP 8.5), and consider historical data of climate, vegetation, population density, and large (> 400 ha) fire history. Users may select from four model simulations to view the range in potential wildfire probabilities for the grid cell. The four simulations make different assumptions about expected rainfall and temperature are: Warmer/drier (HadGEM2-ES), Cooler/wetter (CNRM-CM5), Average conditions (CanESM2), Range of different rainfall and temperature possibilities (MIROC5). Each grid cell is 6 kilometers (km) by 6 km, or 3.7 miles (mi) by 3.7 mi.

INTRODUCTION 
This report provides an analysis of noise impacts associated with the City of Buellton’s Willemsen Addition to River View Park. This report also provides a summary of existing conditions in the project area and applicable noise standards. The proposed project site plan is depicted in Figures 1. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The Project consists of a Final Development Plan (22-FDP-XX) to construct a multi-purpose recreational and event facility on a 24+/-acre site (APNs 099-660-032, -033, -034, -035, & 099-670-005). The site is divided into a 4-acre upper portion and a 20-acre lower portion. 
The upper portion (about 4 acres) contains an existing residence (3,200 square feet), an existing dairy barn (designated as a historic structure by the City of Buellton), and an existing 1,600 square foot open storage shed. The lower portion (about 20 acres) is vacant (except for the 1.25-acre horseback riding facility already operating). Was formerly used for hay farming (at least 8-10 years ago). 
Proposed uses for the upper portion consist of: 
• 
Library (approximately 2,430 square feet) and Community rooms (1,565 square feet) in converted existing residence -Given library facilities in Solvang, Goleta, Lompoc, and Los Alamos, library patrons are expected to primarily be residents of Buellton and nearby rural residents. 

• 
Wedding/Event facility in Barn (about 7,000 square feet) includes warming kitchen and 2nd floor apartment space (up to 150 persons per event). These events are expected to occur about 1 per month; 

• 
Outdoor active play area “Children’s Museum” -about 30,00 square feet of area, including 1,600 square feet of covered space (current open storage shed). Restroom facilities and play equipment to be installed. This use is intended to serve the general Santa Ynez Valley population. 


Proposed uses for the lower portion consist of: 
• 
1.25-acre horseback riding center (horse corrals and small office structure w/ storage. Approximately 24 trips per day maximum anticipated; 

• 
Paved parking lot (about 1.5 acres) with about 112 parking spaces to serve upper and lower portion uses. Future restroom facility. Parking area to be reached by new access road across (non­jurisdictional) drainage channel from River View Park east parking lot; 

• 
Possible 10,000 square feet expansion of Children’s Museum play area 

• 
Sport facilities/play fields (about 15 acres) with parking and restroom facilities: 2 full sized soccer fields, of which 1 will not be available for open play, but only used for infrequent club events, 1 mid-sized field, and 1 small sized soccer field, baseball/softball field, 2 pickleball/multi-use courts, some supplemental parking (40 spaces) and restroom facility -non-club fields and courts will primarily serve local valley recreational needs. Soccer fields could accommodate small tournaments (4 per year maximum anticipated). Approximately 2,150 trips generated per tournament over the course of an 8 to 10-hour day. Tournaments held in this location are expected to relocate here from other less desirable sites in the Santa Ynez Valley that are currently used for soccer tournaments; 

• 
Assume about 2.5 acres to remain undeveloped (berm along south boundary of property/well area).

ACOUSTIC FUNDAMENTALS 
Noise is generally defined as sound that is loud, disagreeable, or unexpected. Sound, as described in more detail below, is mechanical energy transmitted in the form of a wave because of a disturbance or vibration. 
AMPLITUDE 
Amplitude is the difference between ambient air pressure and the peak pressure of the sound wave. Amplitude is measured in decibels (dB) on a logarithmic scale as discussed below. Amplitude is interpreted by the ear as corresponding to different degrees of loudness. Laboratory measurements have determined that a 10 dB increase in amplitude correlates with a perceived doubling of loudness and a 3 dB change in amplitude is the minimum audible difference perceptible to the average person. 
FREQUENCY 
Frequency is the number of fluctuations of the pressure wave per second. The unit of frequency is the Hertz (Hz). One Hz equals one cycle per second. The human ear is not equally sensitive to sound of different frequencies. Sound waves below 16 Hz or above 20,000 Hz cannot be heard at all, and the ear is more sensitive to sound in the higher portion of this range than in the lower. To approximate this sensitivity, environmental sound is usually measured in A-weighted decibels (dBA). On this scale, the normal range of human hearing extends from about 10 dBA to about 140 dBA. Common community noise sources and associated noise levels, in dBA, are depicted in Figure 2. 
ADDITION OF DECIBELS 
Because decibels are logarithmic units, sound levels cannot be added or subtracted through ordinary arithmetic. Under the decibel scale, a doubling of sound energy corresponds to a 3-dB increase. In other words, when two identical sources are each producing sound of the same loudness, the resulting sound level at a given distance would be 3 dB higher than one source under the same conditions. For example, if one automobile produces a sound level of 70 dB when it passes an observer, two cars passing simultaneously would not produce 140 dB; rather, they would combine to produce 73 dB. Under the decibel scale, three sources of equal loudness together would produce an increase of 5 dB. 
SOUND PROPAGATION & ATTENUATION 
Geometric Spreading 
Sound from a localized source (i.e., a point source) propagates uniformly outward in a spherical pattern. The sound level decreases (attenuates) at a rate of approximately 6 dB for each doubling of distance from a point source. Highways consist of several localized noise sources on a defined path, and hence can be treated as a line source, which approximates the effect of several point sources. Noise from a line source propagates outward in a cylindrical pattern, often referred to as cylindrical spreading. Sound levels attenuate at a rate of approximately 3 dB for each doubling of distance from a line source, depending on ground surface characteristics. For acoustically hard sites (i.e., sites with a reflective surface between the source and the receiver, such as a parking lot or body of water,), no excess ground attenuation is assumed. For acoustically absorptive or soft sites (i.e., those sites with an absorptive ground surface between a line source and the receiver, such as soft dirt, grass, or scattered bushes and trees), an excess ground-attenuation value of 1.5 dB per doubling of distance is normally assumed. When added to the cylindrical spreading, the excess ground attenuation for soft surfaces results in an overall attenuation rate of 4.5 dB per doubling of distance from a line source.

Shielding by Natural or Human-Made Features 
A large object or barrier in the path between a noise source and a receiver can substantially attenuate noise levels at the receiver. The amount of attenuation provided by shielding depends on the size of the object and the frequency content of the noise source. Natural terrain features (e.g., hills and dense woods) and human-made features (e.g., buildings and walls) can substantially reduce noise levels. Walls are often constructed between a source and a receiver specifically to reduce noise. A barrier that breaks the line of sight between a source and a receiver will typically result in an approximate 5 dB of noise reduction. Taller barriers provide increased noise reduction. Intervening buildings can reduce noise levels by as much as approximately 15 dB. 
NOISE DESCRIPTORS 
The decibel scale alone does not adequately characterize how humans perceive noise. The dominant frequencies of a sound have a substantial effect on the human response to that sound. Although the intensity (energy per unit area) of the sound is a purely physical quantity, the loudness or human response is determined by the characteristics of the human ear. 
Human hearing is limited in the range of audible frequencies as well as in the way it perceives the sound-pressure level in that range. In general, people are most sensitive to the frequency range of 1,000 to 8,000 Hz, and perceive sounds within that range better than sounds of the same amplitude in higher or lower frequencies. To approximate the response of the human ear, sound levels of individual frequency bands are weighted, depending on the human sensitivity to those frequencies, which is referred to as the “A-weighted” sound level (expressed in units of dBA). The A-weighting network approximates the frequency response of the average young ear when listening to most ordinary sounds. When people make judgments of the relative loudness or annoyance of a sound, their judgments correlate well with the A-weighted noise scale. Other weighting networks have been devised to address high noise levels or other special problems (e.g., B-, C-, and D-scales), but these scales are rarely used in conjunction with environmental noise. In addition, the intensity of environmental noise fluctuates over time, and several descriptors of time-averaged noise levels are typically used. Common noise descriptors used in this analysis are summarized in Table 1. 
TABLE 1. COMMON ACOUSTICAL DESCRIPTORS 
Descriptor  Definition  
Energy Equivalent Noise Level (Leq)  The mean (average) energy noise level. The instantaneous noise levels during a specific period of time in dBA are converted to relative energy values. From the sum of the relative energy values, an average energy value (in dBA) is calculated.  
Minimum Noise Level (Lmin)  The minimum instantaneous noise level during a specific period of time.  
Maximum Noise Level (Lmax)  The maximum instantaneous noise level during a specific period of time.  
Day-Night Average Noise Level (DNL or Ldn)  The DNL was first recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in 1974 as a “simple, uniform and appropriate way” of measuring long-term environmental noise. DNL takes into account both the frequency of occurrence and duration of all noise events during a 24-hour period with a 10 dBA “penalty” for noise events that occur between the more noise-sensitive hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. In other words, 10 dBA is “added” to noise events that occur in the nighttime hours to account for increased sensitivity to noise during these hours.  
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)  The CNEL is similar to the Ldn described above, but with an additional 5 dBA “penalty” added to noise events that occur between the hours of 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. The calculated CNEL is typically approximately 0.5 dBA higher than the calculated Ldn.  
Sound Exposure Level (SEL)  The level of sound accumulated over a given time interval or event. Technically, the sound exposure level is the level of the time-integrated mean square A-weighted sound for a stated time interval or event, with a reference time of one second.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 
CITY OF BUELLTON GENERAL PLAN NOISE ELEMENT 
The City of Buellton’s General Plan establishes noise standards for the purpose of protecting noise-sensitive uses from excessive noise either through noise-reducing project design features or by allowing noise sensitive land uses to only locate in areas with ambient noise levels below specific thresholds. The City’s noise standards for land use compatibility are depicted in Figure 3. These noise standards apply to newly proposed land uses. 
In addition, the City of Buellton’s General Plan also establishes standards for the evaluation of increases in noise levels associated with proposed development projects. The City’s noise standards for increases in noise levels associated with proposed development projects are summarized in Table 2.

CITY OF BUELLTON MUNICIPAL CODE 
The City of Buellton’s Municipal Code (Title 8, Section 04.030, Public Nuisances Designated) establishes noise 
standards for non-transportation noise sources. These noise standards are based on average-hourly noise levels and applied based on the land use designation of the receiving land use. The code includes additional adjustments to account for variations in the noise characteristics of the source and ambient noise conditions. The City’s noise standards for non-transportation noise sources are summarized in Table 3. In addition, the use of amplified sound systems, musical instruments, and other production and reproduction devices are typically limited to between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. when audible in exterior areas at a distance of 50 feet.

The City’s Municipal Code (Title 8, Section 04.030, Public Nuisances Designated) also establishes noise 
standards and hourly limitations for noise-generating construction activities. Accordingly, Noise-generating construction activities are generally limited to between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. work shall be performed on Saturday without the written approval of the city of Buellton. Activities on Saturdays are limited to between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., with City approval. Noise-generating construction activities are typically prohibited Sundays and holidays. In addition, construction activities shall not exceed an hourly-average noise level of 75 dBA Leq at nearby properties zoned for open space, recreation, or residential purposes.

AMBIENT NOISE ENVIRONMENT 
NOISE-SENSITIVE RECEPTORS 
Noise-sensitive land uses are generally considered to include those uses where noise exposure could result in health-related risks to individuals, as well as places where quiet is an essential element of their intended purpose. Residential dwellings are of primary concern because of the potential for increased and prolonged exposure of individuals to both interior and exterior noise levels. Additional land uses such as parks, historic sites, cemeteries, and recreation areas are also considered sensitive to increases in exterior noise levels. Schools, churches, hotels, libraries, and other places where low interior noise levels are essential are also considered noise-sensitive land uses. Noise-sensitive receptors in the project area consist predominantly of residential dwellings generally located north and east of the project site, River View Park is located adjacent to and west of the project site (refer to Figure 1). 
AMBIENT NOISE LEVELS 
To document existing ambient noise levels at the project site, short-term ambient noise measurements were conducted on April 20, 2023. Noise measurements were conducted using a SoftdB Piccolo Type II sound-level meter positioned at a height of approximately 5 feet above ground level. Noise measurement equipment was calibrated prior to and upon completion of the noise measurement survey. Measured ambient noise levels are summarized in Table 4. Based on the ambient noise measurements conducted, the noise environment in the proposed project area is defined primarily by vehicular traffic on area roadways. To a lesser extent, activities at nearby park and residential land uses (e.g., landscape maintenance) also contributes to ambient noise levels in the project area. 
TABLE 4. SUMMARY OF SHORT-TERM MEASURED AMBIENT EXTERIOR NOISE LEVELS 
Location  Monitoring Period  Noise Levels (dBA Leq)

Near the western boundary of the project site approximately 300 feet south of Valley Dairy Road  1:10 p.m. – 1:20 p.m.  41.2  
Ambient noise measurements were conducted using a SoftdB Piccolo Type II integrating sound-level meter placed at a height of approximately 5 feet above ground level. Equipment was calibrated prior to and upon completion of the noise measurements.  

GROUNDBORNE VIBRATION 
Vibration is like noise in that it involves a source, a transmission path, and a receiver. While vibration is related to noise, it differs in that noise is generally considered to be pressure waves transmitted through air, whereas vibration usually consists of the excitation of a structure or surface. As with noise, vibration consists of 
amplitude and frequency. A person’s perception of the vibration will depend on their individual sensitivity to 
vibration, as well as the amplitude and frequency of the source and the response of the system which is vibrating. Vibration can be measured in terms of acceleration, velocity, or displacement. Measurements in terms of velocity are expressed as peak particle velocity (ppv) with units of inches per second (in/sec). 
There are no federal, state, or local regulatory standards for groundborne vibration. However, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has developed vibration criteria based on potential structural damage risks and human annoyance. Caltrans-recommended criteria for the evaluation of groundborne vibration levels, with regard to structural damage and human annoyance, are summarized in Table 5. The criteria apply to continuous vibration sources, which include vehicle traffic and most construction activities. All damage criteria for buildings are in terms of ground motion at the buildings' foundations. No allowance is included for the amplifying effects of structural components (Caltrans 2020).

As indicated in Table 5, the threshold at which there is a risk to normal structures from continuous events is 0.3 in/sec ppv for older residential structures and 0.5 in/sec ppv for newer building construction. With regard to human perception, vibration levels would begin to become distinctly perceptible at levels of 0.04 in/sec ppv for continuous events. Continuous vibration levels begin to become unpleasant for people at levels of approximately 0.4 in/sec ppv (Caltrans 2020). 
TABLE 5. SUMMARY OF GROUNDBORNE VIBRATION LEVELS AND POTENTIAL EFFECTS 
Vibration Level (in/sec ppv)  Human Reaction  Effect on Buildings  
0.006 -0.019  Threshold of perception; possibility of intrusion.  Vibrations unlikely to cause damage of any type.  
0.08  Vibrations readily perceptible.  Recommended upper level of the vibration to which ruins and ancient monuments should be subjected.  
0.1  Level at which continuous vibrations begin to annoy people.  Virtually no risk of “architectural” damage to normal buildings.  
0.2  Vibrations annoying to people in buildings (this agrees with the levels established for people standing on bridges and subjected to relatively short periods of vibrations).  Threshold at which there is a risk of “architectural” damage to fragile buildings.  
0.3 -0.6  Vibrations become unpleasant at 0.4-0.6 in/sec ppv by people when subjected to continuous vibrations.  Potential risk of “architectural” damage may occur at levels above 0.3 in/sec ppv for older residential structures and above 0.5 in/sec ppv for newer structures.  
in/sec = Inch per second; ppv = Peak particle velocity. The vibration levels are based on ppv in the vertical direction for continuous vibration sources, which includes most construction activities. Source: Caltrans 2020  

IMPACT ANALYSIS 
THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE 
Criteria for determining the significance of air quality impacts were developed based on information contained in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines (Appendix G). According to those guidelines, a project may have a significant effect on the environment if it would result in the following conditions: 
a) 
Generation of a substantial temporary or permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity in excess of standards established in the local general plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards of other agencies; or 

b) 
Generation of excessive groundborne vibration or groundborne noise levels; or 

c) 
Located within the vicinity of a private airstrip or an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted, within two miles of a public airport or private-use airport, that exposes people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels. 


The CEQA Guidelines do not define the levels at which temporary and permanent increases in ambient noise 
are considered “substantial.” As discussed previously in this section, a noise level increase of 3 dBA is barely 
perceptible to most people, an increase of 5 dBA is readily noticeable, and a difference of 10 dBA would be perceived as a doubling of loudness. In accordance with the City of Buellton General Plan noise standards, a significant increase in ambient noise levels would be defined as an increase of 5 dBA or greater for an ambient noise level of less than 60 dB; a 3 dB, or greater, increase in an ambient noise level of 60-65 dB; or a 
1.5 dB greater, increase in an ambient noise level above 65 dB (Refer to Table 2). In order for a receptor to 
have a significant impact there would need to be a substantial increase that would also exceed the City’s applicable noise standards. The City’s applicable noise standards are summarized in Table 3. 
The CEQA Guidelines also do not define the levels at which groundborne vibration levels would be considered excessive. For this reason, Caltrans recommended groundborne vibration thresholds were used for the evaluation of impacts based on increased potential for structural damage and human annoyance, as identified in Table 5. For purposes of this analysis, risks of architectural damage (i.e., minor cracking of plaster walls and ceilings) and significant increases in human annoyance would be considered potentially significant if ground vibration levels at nearby structures would exceed 0.5 in/sec ppv.

METHODOLOGY 
Construction Impacts 
Short-term noise impacts associated with construction activities were analyzed based on typical construction equipment noise levels and distances to the nearest noise-sensitive land usage. Noise levels were predicted based on representative off-road equipment noise levels derived from the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Roadway Construction Noise Model based on average equipment usage rates and assuming a noise-attenuation rate of 6 dB per doubling of distance from the source. 
Operational Impacts 
Noise levels generated by other on-site noise sources, including paly areas, sports fields, and event center activities were assessed based on representative noise levels obtained from similar sources. Noise levels associated with vehicle parking areas were calculated in accordance with FTA’s Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment Guidelines (2018) assuming a reference noise level of 92 dBA SEL. Average-hourly noise levels associated with vehicle parking-related activities were calculated based on the conservative assumption that all parking spaces would be accessed over a one-hour period. Increases in traffic noise levels were qualitatively assessed based, in part, on data derived from the traffic analysis prepared for this project and the City of Buellton General Plan Noise Element (ATE 2023, City of Buellton 2005). 
PROJECT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES 
Impact Noise-A. Would the project result in a substantial temporary or permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity in excess of standards established in the local general plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards of other agencies? 
Construction-Related Noise Levels 
Construction noise typically occurs intermittently and varies depending upon the nature or phase (e.g., land clearing, grading, excavation, and erection) of the activity. Noise generated by construction equipment, including earthmovers, material handlers, and portable generators, can reach high levels. Noise levels commonly associated with off-road equipment anticipated to be used during project construction are summarized in Table 6.

As noted in Table 6, instantaneous noise levels generated by individual pieces of off-road equipment typically range from approximately 77 to 90 dBA Lmax at 50 feet. Typical operating cycles may involve 2 minutes of full power, followed by 3 or 4 minutes at lower settings. Based on typical off-road equipment usage rates, average-hourly noise levels for individual equipment would be approximately 83 dBA Leq, or less, at 50 feet. Assuming that multiple pieces of equipment could be operating simultaneously, predicted average-hourly noise levels could reach levels of approximately 85 dBA Leq at 50 feet. 
The nearest noise-sensitive receivers to the project site include existing residences generally located to the north and east of the project site. Assuming an average-hourly construction noise level of 85 dBA Leq at 50 feet and that construction activities were to occur at the nearest property boundary, predicted noise levels could potentially exceed the City’s noise standard of 75 dBA Leq at nearby residential land uses. With regard to residential land uses, activities occurring during the more noise-sensitive nighttime hours are of particular concern given the potential for sleep disruption and increased levels of annoyance for building occupants. For these reasons, this impact would be considered potentially significant. 
Mitigation Measures 
Noise-1: The following measures shall be implemented to reduce construction-generated noise levels: 
a) 
Construction activity shall be limited to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, and between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays (with City approval). Noise-generating construction activities shall be prohibited on Sundays and state or federal holidays. Construction equipment maintenance shall be limited to the same hours. 

b) 
Control noise at all construction sites through the provision of mufflers and the physical separation of machinery maintenance and equipment staging areas from adjacent residential land uses. 

c) 
Construction activities shall comply with the City of Buellton’s noise-control ordinance requirements, including obtaining a permit if deemed necessary. 


Significance After Mitigation 
Implementation of the above mitigation measures would limit construction activities to less noise-sensitive periods of the day. The use of mufflers would reduce construction equipment noise levels by approximately 10 dBA. With the implementation of the above mitigation measures and given that construction activities would be short-term and intermittent, this impact would be considered less than significant. 
Operational Noise Levels 
Long-term, permanent increases in ambient noise levels would be primarily associated with potential increases in vehicle traffic on nearby roadways, as well as on-site activities. Noise levels commonly associated with these sources and potential impacts to nearby land uses are discussed as follows: 
Vehicular Roadway Traffic 
Typically, several thousand vehicles per day would be required before traffic noise levels along roadways would begin to exceed applicable noise standards at nearby noise-sensitive land uses. In addition, a double of vehicle traffic is typically required before a noticeable increase (i.e., 3 dB, or greater) in traffic noise levels would occur. Implementation of the proposed project would not result in a doubling of vehicle traffic along nearby major roadways. As a result, implementation of the proposed project would not result in a significant increase in traffic noise levels that would exceed applicable noise standards at nearby land uses. Other nearby local roadways in the project vicinity do not have sufficient volumes. This impact would be considered less than significant. 
Compatibility of Proposed Land Uses with Predicted Future Traffic Noise Levels 
As previously discussed, ambient noise levels at the project site are primarily influenced by vehicle traffic on area roadways. The nearest major roadway in the project vicinity is State Highway 246. The project site is not located within the predicted noise contours of major roadways (City of Buellton 2008). In addition, based on the ambient noise measurement surveys conducted, ambient noise levels in the project area would not

11  

exceed the City’s “normally acceptable” noise standards for land use compatibility of 65 dBA CNEL/Ldn (refer to Figure 1). This impact would be considered less than significant. 
Non-Transportation Noise Sources 
Non-transportation noise sources associated with the proposed project having the greqtest potential to adversely impact nearby residential land uses would be primarily associated with sports fields, special events, play areas, and vehicle parking lots. Predicted noise levels at the nearest residential land uses associated with these noise sources are summarized in Table 7. As depicted, predicted noise levels associated with these major onsite noise sources would not exceed the City’s daytime noise standard of 65 dBA Leq at the property line of the nearest residential land uses. It is important to note that River View Park operational hours are typically limited to between the daytime hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. However, in the event that special events were to extend beyond normal operational hours, predicted noise levels at nearby residential land uses could potentially exceed the City’s nighttime noise standard of 45 dBA Leq. To be conservative, this impact would be considered potentially significant. 
TABLE 7. PREDICTED NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE LEVELS AT NEAREST RESIDENTIAL LAND USE 
Source  Distance (Feet)1  Noise Level (dBA Leq) Without Mitigation2  Exceeds Noise Standard?  
Daytime3 (65 dBA Leq)  Nighttime4 (45 dBA Leq)  
Sports Fields (e.g., Competitive Event with Spectators)  400  42  No  No  
Special Events (e.g., Weddings with Amplified Sound System)  190  58  No  Yes  
Outdoor Park/Childrens Play Area  65  39  No  No  
Parking Lot (112 Spaces)  325  27  No  No  
1. Based on distance from source center to the nearest residential property line. 2. Predicted noise levels were calculated based on noise measurement surveys at similar land uses. Parking lot noise levels were calculated assuming a maximum of 112 parking spaces at one location with all spaces accessed over a one-hour period. Parking noise levels were calculated using the FTA Noise Impact Assessment Spreadsheet (2018). Predicted noise levels exceeding applicable noise standard depicted in bold. 3. Daytime is between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 4. Nighttime is between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.  

Mitigation Measures Noise-2: Special events shall be prohibited between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
Significant after Mitigation 
Mitigation Measure Noise-2 would prohibit special events during the nighttime hours. With mitigation, this impact would be considered less than significant.

Impact Noise-B. Would the project result in the exposure of persons to or generation of excessive   groundborne vibration or groundborne noise levels? 
Increases in groundborne vibration levels attributable to the proposed project would be primarily associated with short-term construction activities. Groundborne vibration levels associated with representative construction equipment likely to be required during project construction are summarized in Table 8. As depicted, construction-generated vibration levels would range from approximately 0.003 to 0.21 in/sec ppv at 25 feet. The highest vibration levels would be associated with the use of vibratory rollers.

Equipment  Vibration Level at 25 Feet (in/sec, ppv)

Large Bulldozer  0.089  
Loaded Trucks  0.076  
Small Bulldozers/Tractors  0.003  
in/sec = Inch per second; ppv = Peak particle velocity Source: FTA 2018  

Implementation of the proposed project would not involve the demolition of existing structures. Offroad equipment used in the general vicinity of existing onsite and offsite structures, such as development of the children’s play area, would consist of smaller tractors and equipment. The use of larger heavy-duty equipment and vibratory rollers would not be largely associated with construction activities occurring in the southern portion of the project site associated with construction of the sports fields, as well as, parking areas. The use of larger off-road equipment and vibratory rollers would not be anticipated to occur within 25 feet of existing structures As a result, predicted construction vibration levels at existing structures would not exceed the minimum recommended criteria for structural damage or human annoyance (0.5 and 0.4 in/sec ppv, respectively). This impact would be considered less than significant. 
Impact Noise-C. For a project located within an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted, within two miles of a public airport or public use airport, would the project expose people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels? and for a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, would the project expose people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels? 
The project site is not located within 2 miles of a public airport or private airstrip or within an airport land use planning area. The nearest airport is the Santa Ynez Airport, which is located approximately 7 miles east of the project site. The proposed project would not result in exposure of individuals to aircraft noise levels that would exceed applicable noise standards. As a result, this impact would be considered less than significant.

TRIP GENERATION FOR THE WILLEMSEN ADDITION TO RIVER VIEW PARK -CITY OF BUELLTON 
The following is the projection of the AADT for use in the Air and Noise analysis for the IS­MND for the proposed Willemsen Addition to River View Park. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The Project consists of a Final Development Plan (22-FDP-XX) to construct a multi-purpose recreational and event facility on a 24+/-acre site (APNs 099-660-032, -033, -034, -035, & 099-670-005). The site is divided into a 4-acre upper portion and a 20-acre lower portion. Figure 1 illustrates the Project site plan. 
The upper portion (about 4 acres) contains an existing residence (3,200 square feet), an existing dairy barn (designated as a historic structure by the City of Buellton), and an existing 1,600 square foot open storage shed. The lower portion (about 20 acres) is vacant (except for the 1.25-acre horseback riding facility already operating). Was formerly used for hay farming (at least 8-10 years ago). The elements and activity locations are shown on Figure 2. 
Proposed uses for the upper portion consist of: 
• 
Library (approximately 2,430 square feet) and Community rooms (1,565 square feet) in converted existing residence -Given library facilities in Solvang, Goleta, Lompoc, and Los Alamos, library patrons are expected to primarily be residents of Buellton and nearby rural residents; 

• 
Wedding/Event facility in Barn (about 7,000 square feet) includes warming kitchen and 2nd floor apartment space (up to 150 persons per event). These events are expected to occur about 1 per month; 


Engineering • Planning • Parking • Signal Systems • Impact Reports • Bikeways • Transit 
Scott Wolfe Page 2 March 10, 2023 
• Outdoor active play area “Children’s Museum” -about 30,00 square feet of area, including 1,600 square feet of covered space (current open storage shed). Restroom facilities and play equipment to be installed. This use is intended to serve the general Santa Ynez Valley population, 
Proposed uses for the lower portion consist of: 
• 
1.25-acre horseback riding center (horse corrals and small office structure w/ storage. Approximately 24 trips per day maximum anticipated; 

• 
Paved parking lot (about 1.5 acres) with about 112 parking spaces to serve upper and lower portion uses. Future restroom facility. Parking area to be reached by new access road across (non-jurisdictional) drainage channel from River View Park east parking lot; 

• 
Possible 10,000 square feet expansion of Children’s Museum play area 

• 
Sport facilities/play fields (about 15 acres) with parking and restroom facilities: 2 full sized soccer fields, of which 1 will not be available for open play, but only used for infrequent club events, 1 mid-sized field, and 1 small sized soccer field, baseball/softball field, 2 pickleball/multi-use courts, some supplemental parking (40 spaces) and restroom facility -non-club fields and courts will primarily serve local valley recreational needs. Soccer fields could accommodate small tournaments (4 per year max anticipated). Approximately 2,150 trips generated per tournament over the course of an 8 to 10-hour day. Tournaments held in this location are expected to relocate here from other less desirable sites in the Santa Ynez Valley that are currently used for soccer tournaments; 

• 
Assume about 2.5 acres to remain undeveloped (berm along south boundary of property/well area). 


PROJECT TRIP GENERATION 
The Willemsen Addition is an expansion of River View Park and is intended primarily for use by Buellton area residents. The traffic will generally be local in nature and not intended to be a regional destination and draw for the general public from other areas. Much of the activity and usage will be on weekends, with the possibility that some soccer related activities would occur on weekday afternoons. The Air and Noise analysis uses Daily Traffic volume as the parameter. The AM and PM peak hour traffic will be minimal and will not affect the roadway or intersection operations in the Buellton area.

The library and meeting room in the converted single-family residence will be a relocation of the existing library located in the Post Office complex, thus no increase in local traffic volumes. 
Daily trips for each of the activities are based on the probable numbers expected to attend. The expected attendance related trips for the event totals have been expressed as if a portion occurred on each day for the Air and Noise evaluation. A summary of the trips is shown in Table 1.

Total Trips:  174  

The data presented in Table 1 indicates that the Willemsen Addition Project is forecast to generate a daily equivalent of 174 average daily trips. 
SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION 
Vehicular access to the upper portion is proposed via a connection to Valley Dairy Drive. Vehicular access to the lower portion is proposed through River View Park via Sycamore Drive. 
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED ANALYSIS 
The Willemsen Addition is considered a “Small Project” under the City of Buellton CEQA guidelines, thus the VMT impact would be considered less than significant. 
Scott Wolfe Page 4 March 10, 2023 
SUMMARY 
The Willemsen Addition to River View Park Project is forecast to generate a daily equivalent ADT of 174 trips. Recent State law has adopted Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) as the new CEQA metric to determine transportation impacts. The Project is considered a “Small Project“ and therefore would have a less than significant VMT impact based on the City of Buellton CEQA guidelines.

RCRAInfo is EPA’s comprehensive information system that supports the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 through the tracking of events and activities related to facilities that generate, transport, and treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste. RCRAInfo allows RCRA program staff to track the notification, permit, compliance, and corrective action activities required under RCRA. RCRAInfo also supports generation of the National Hazardous Waste Biennial Report. All generators and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities who handle hazardous waste are required to report to the EPA Administrator at least once every two years to support creation of the Biennial Report. 
Source Description : 
The California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) has recently implemented a new data warehouse system (nSite). This data warehouse combines and merges facility and site information from five different systems managed within CalEPA. The five systems are: California Environmental Reporting System (CERS), EnviroStor, GeoTracker, California Integrated Water Quality System (CIWQS), and Toxic Release Inventory (TRI).

HYDROLOGIC UNIT Hydrologic Unit Maps USGS The United States Geological Survey created a hierarchical system of hydrologic units originally called regions, sub­regions, accounting units, and cataloging units. Each unit was assigned a unique Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC). As first implemented the system had 21 regions, 221 subregions, 378 accounting units, and 2,264 cataloging units. Over time the system was changed and expanded. As of 2010 there are six levels in the hierarchy, represented by hydrologic unit codes from 2 to 12 digits long, called regions, subregions, basins, subbasins, watersheds, and subwatersheds. The table below describes the system's hydrologic unit levels and their characteristics, along with example names and codes.

1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1.1 FINDINGS 
The Phase One Group has performed a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (Phase 1 ESA) in general accordance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of the Residential/Agricultural Property located at 202 Dairyland Road, in the City of Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 (the “subject property”). The Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment is designed to provide the City of Buellton with an assessment concerning environmental conditions as they exist at the subject property. Any exceptions to or deletions from this scope of work are described in the report. 
The site inspection was performed by Mr. Mark E. Smith, Environmental Professional, a representative of The Phase One Group, on May 11, 2020. The subject property is located at 202 Dairyland Road, in the City of Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427. 
The subject property is located on the southwest side of Dairyland Road, on the south side of the intersection of Dairyland Road and Valley Dairy Road.  The subject property consists of a total of five contiguous parcels of land totaling approximately 21.25-acres identified by the Santa Barbara County Assessor as Assessor’s Parcel Numbers (APNs) 099-660-032, 099-660-033, 099-660-034, 099-660-035 and 099-670-005.  The subject property is a residential/agricultural property improved with a single-story dwelling, a refurbished barn, a maintenance shop and two storage sheds.  The remainder of the subject property is developed with a pavestone driveway and walkway, a concrete-paved walkway, a goat corral and chicken pen, landscaping, pastureland, and undeveloped land. The subject property is equipped with one irrigation groundwater well. At the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit, the subject property was in the process of being vacated to be sold.  Evidence of hazardous materials and petroleum products storage was observed at the subject property during the site visit. 
Based on a review of historical sources, the northeastern portion of the subject property appeared to be improved with a dwelling and developed for agricultural purposes as an orchard, and the remainder of the subject property appeared to be undeveloped from prior to 1928 until prior to 1938, when the existing barn was developed on the northeastern portion of the subject property and the subject property was reportedly used as a dairy farm, identified as the Willemsen Dairy.  By 1943, additional farm-related structures and development were built on the northeastern portion of the subject property and by 1954 the southwestern portion of the subject property appeared to be used for pastureland as part of the dairy farm.  By 1969, a retention basin appeared to be developed on the southeastern portion of the subject property, and by 1973, the southwestern portion of the subject property appeared to be developed for agricultural purposes.  The subject property reportedly continued to be used as a dairy farm and for agricultural purposes until 1996, when the dairy farm ceased operations and the existing dwelling was developed on the northeastern portion of the subject property.  The existing barn was reportedly refurbished and improved with a workshop, kitchen and a loft studio apartment. In addition, the existing maintenance shop was built on-site, and 

The Phase One Group 1 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
subsequently developed with two storage sheds.  At the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit, the subject property was in the process of being vacated to be sold. 
The subject property was historically used as a dairy farm operation.  It is unknown where wastewater discharge generated from the former dairy farm operation was directed to at the subject property.  The subject property soils in the area of the former dairy farm operation due to wastewater discharge may contain excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals. Based on the above, the former dairy farm operation represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 
A retention basin appeared to be located on the southeastern portion of the subject property on the historical aerial photographs dated 1969, 1973, 1978 and 1981. The retention basin was no longer on-site at the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit. The subject property soils in the area of the retention basin may contain agricultural related chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, along with excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals.  The subject property soils within the former retention basin location represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 
The northeastern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes as an orchard on the historical aerial photograph dated 1928, and the southwestern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes on the historical aerial photographs dated 1973, 1978 and 1981. There is a potential that agricultural related chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers may have been used at the subject property.  Based on the above, the former agricultural use at the subject property represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 
At the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit, an area of oil-stained soil and gravel approximately eight feet by eight feet in size was observed within the on-site maintenance shop building. The stained soil and gravel represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 
The subject property is not listed in the Envirosite Corporation (Envirosite) environmental database report. 
The subject property is located within a mixed residential and industrial area of the City of Buellton.  The vicinity of the subject property can be described as Dairyland Road and the intersection of Dairyland Road and Meadow View Drive, followed by four dwellings (224, 228 Dairyland Road and 217, 228 Valley Dairy Road) to the northeast, Ranch Club Mobile Estates (330 West Highway 246), the Buellton Wastewater Treatment Plant (79 Industrial Way) and vacant land (no address identified) to the southeast; the Santa Ynez River to the southwest; and the City of Buellton River View Park (151 Sycamore Drive) to the northwest.

1.2 CONCLUSIONS 
The Phase One Group has performed a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard E1527-13 of the Residential/Agricultural Property located at 202 Dairyland Road, in the City of Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 (the “subject property”). Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 2.0 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions (RECs), historical recognized environmental conditions (HRECs), or controlled recognized environmental conditions (CRECs) in connection with the subject property, except for the following: 
• 
At the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit, an area of stained soil and gravel approximately eight feet by eight feet in size was observed within the on-site maintenance shop building.  The stained soil and gravel represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 

• 
The subject property was historically used as a dairy farm operation.  It is unknown where wastewater discharge generated from the former dairy farm operation was directed to at the subject property. The subject property soils in the area of the former dairy farm operation due to wastewater discharge may contain excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals.  Based on the above, the former dairy farm operation represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 

• 
A retention basin appeared to be located on the southeastern portion of the subject property on the historical aerial photographs dated 1969, 1973, 1978 and 1981. The retention basin was no longer on-site at the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit.  The subject property soils in the area of the retention basin may contain agricultural related chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, along with excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals. The subject property soils within the former retention basin location represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 

• 
The northeastern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes as an orchard on the historical aerial photograph dated 1928, and the southwestern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes on the historical aerial photographs dated 1973, 1978 and 1981.

Based on the above, the former agricultural use at the subject property represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 


An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by The Phase One Group, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion. The following environmental issues were identified during the course of this assessment: 

The Phase One Group 3 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
• 
An unlabeled 88-gallon capacity portable aboveground storage tank (AST) reportedly containing diesel fuel was observed stored outside along the southeastern border of the subject property, an unlabeled 55-gallon capacity portable AST stored outside along the southwestern side of the barn, and numerous pails and containers of hydraulic oil, lubricants and maintenance chemicals were observed stored outside adjacent to maintenance shop. No evidence of leaks or staining was observed in the areas of the ASTs and containers of hydraulic oil, lubricants and maintenance chemicals. 

• 
Based on the subject property use as a former dairy farm operation, the possibility exists that the subject property is equipped with undocumented fuel underground storage tanks (USTs).  No evidence of on-site USTs was observed during the site visit. 

• 
Although no evidence was identified during the site visit, historical on-site septic systems associated with the former on-site structures may be present on-site. 

• 
The subject property is equipped with one irrigation groundwater well located on the southern portion of the subject property.  The irrigation groundwater well is reportedly not used for potable use as drinking water to the subject property is provided by the City of Buellton Water System.  No additional information regarding the on-site groundwater well was provided to The Phase One Group. 


1.3 RECOMMENDATIONS 
As a result of this assessment, The Phase One Group recommends the following: 
• 
A limited subsurface investigation should be conducted at the subject property in order to determine the presence or absence of soil and/or groundwater contamination due to the former dairy farm operation and agricultural use, including the location of the former retention basin. 

• 
A limited subsurface investigation should be conducted in the area of oil-stained soil and gravel within the maintenance shop building. 

• 
The observed unlabeled 88-gallon capacity portable aboveground storage tank (AST) reportedly containing diesel fuel was observed stored outside along the southeastern border of the subject property, an unlabeled 55-gallon capacity portable AST stored outside along the southwestern side of the barn, and numerous pails and containers of hydraulic oil, lubricants and maintenance chemicals should be collected and properly disposed of by a certified hazardous waste hauler. 

• 
If on-site USTs are identified during redevelopment activities of the subject property, the USTs should be properly closed and removed following current regulatory procedures and guidelines.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 PURPOSE 
The purpose of this Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (Phase 1 ESA) is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 
2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. The information contained in the Phase 1 ESA report will be used by Client to: 1) evaluate its legal and financial liabilities for transactions related to foreclosure, purchase, sale, loan origination, loan workout or seller financing; 2) evaluate the subject property’s overall development potential, the associated market value and the impact of applicable laws that restrict financial and other types of assistance for the future development of the subject property; and/or 3) determine whether specific actions are required to be performed prior to the foreclosure, purchase, sale, loan origination, loan workout or seller financing of the subject property. 
This Phase 1 ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. §9601) liability (hereinafter, the “landowner liability protections,” or “LLPs”).  ASTM Standard E1527­13 constitutes “all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice” as defined at 42 U.S.C. §9601(35)(B). 
2.2 SCOPE OF WORK 
The scope of work for this Phase 1 ESA is in general accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E1527-13.  This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of environmental regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of an environmental regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  The Phase One Group contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments, in order to determine any current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property.  Additionally, The Phase One Group researched information on the presence of Activity and Use Limitations (AULs) at these agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject 

The Phase One Group 6 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. 
If requested by Client, this Phase 1 ESA report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), mold and/or radon. 
2.3 REPORT RELIANCE 
This assessment was performed at the request of the City of Buellton utilizing methods and procedures consistent with good commercial or customary practices designed to conform to acceptable industry standards.  This report may be distributed to and relied upon by the City of Buellton, its successors and assigns and Conduit to be assigned by the City of Buellton, its successors and assigns with respect to a loan upon the project, together with any rating agency or issuer or purchaser of any security collateralized or otherwise backed up by such loan.  The independent conclusions The Phase One Group’s best professional judgment based on the conditions that existed and the information and data available to us during the course of this assignment. Factual information regarding operations, conditions, and test data provided by the City of Buellton, owner, or its representative has been assumed to be correct and complete. 
2.4 LIMITATIONS 
The information presented in this Phase 1 ESA report is based on the agreed upon scope of work as noted above. The Phase One Group makes no warranties or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of information obtained from information provided or compiled by others. It is possible that information exists beyond the scope of this investigation.  Also, changes in subject property use may have occurred sometime in the past due to variations in rainfall, temperature, water usage, economic, agricultural or other factors. Limited site specific information was made available to The Phase One Group about the subject property.  Additional information that was not found or available to The Phase One Group at the time of writing the report, may result in a modification of the conclusions and recommendations presented.  This report is not a legal opinion. The services performed by The Phase One Group have been conducted in a manner consistent with the level of care ordinarily exercised by members of our profession currently practicing under similar conditions. No other warranty, expressed or implied, is made. 
The Phase One Group notes that all surficial environmental assessments are inherently limited in the sense that conclusions are drawn and recommendations developed from information obtained from limited research and site evaluation.  Subsurface conditions were not field investigated as part of this study and may differ from the conditions implied by the surficial observations.  Additionally, the passage of time may result in a change in the environmental characteristics at this site and surrounding properties. 

The Phase One Group 7 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
The Phase One Group notes that no investigation can absolutely rule out the existence of any hazardous materials at a given site. This assessment has been based upon prior site history and observable conditions and activities.  Existing hazardous materials and contaminants can escape detection using these methods. 
The work performed in conjunction with this assessment and the data developed are intended as a description of available information at the dates and location given.  This report does not warrant against future operations or conditions, nor does it warrant against operations or conditions present of a type or at a location not investigated.  In addition, this report is not intended as a regulatory agency compliance/safety audit or for the purpose of ensuring that all applicable permits and/or operating procedures are current and/or appropriate. 
The Phase One Group recommends that any periodic review of any property should include an update of information on environmental conditions in the area.  The Phase One Group notes that no soils, groundwater, or potable water testing for the presence of hazardous substances was performed for this assessment. 
2.5 LIMITING CONDITIONS 
The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. 
Specific limitations and exceptions to this Phase 1 ESA are more specifically set forth below: 
• 
Interviews with the past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 5.1.2), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this investigation. 

• 
The Phase One Group requested information relative to deed restrictions and environmental liens and a title search from the Report User.  This information was not provided at the time of the assessment. 

• 
The Phase One Group was not able to document the historical use of the subject property prior to 1928.  The following sources were reviewed during the course of this assessment and found to be limited: aerial photographs were not available prior to 1928; historical city directories were not available prior to 2001, Sanborn fire insurance map coverage was not available for the subject property; and historical topographic maps were not reasonably ascertainable from local agencies. This data failure is not considered critical and does not change the conclusions of this report, as the 1928 aerial photograph shows the northeastern portion of the subject property appearing to be improved with a dwelling and developed for agricultural purposes as an orchard, and the remainder of the subject property appearing to be undeveloped.

5.0 RECORDS REVIEW 
5.1 GENERAL PUBLIC RECORDS 
5.1.1 Physical Setting Sources 
5.1.1.1 Topography 
The United States Geological Survey (USGS), Solvang, California Quadrangle 7.5 minute series topographic map was reviewed for this ESA. This map was published by the Geological Survey in 1995. According to the contour lines on the topographic map, the subject property is located approximately 320 feet above Mean Sea Level (msl). The contour lines in the area of the subject property slopes gently to the southwest. The subject property is depicted on the map as improved with five small structures, and the remainder of the subject property is depicted as undeveloped land. 
5.1.1.2 Geology/Soils 
Based on the review of the Geologic Map of California, published by the United States Geological Society (USGS), the subject property is situated in the Coast Ranges California Geomorphic Province. The Coast Ranges are northwest-trending mountain ranges (2,000 to 4,000, occasionally 6,000 feet elevation above sea level), and valleys. The ranges and valleys trend northwest, subparallel to the San Andreas Fault.  Strata dip beneath alluvium of the Great Valley. To the west is the Pacific Ocean.  The coastline is uplifted, terraced and wave-cut. The Coast Ranges are composed of thick Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary strata. The northern and southern ranges are separated by a depression containing the San Francisco Bay. The northern Coast Ranges are dominated by irregular, knobby, landslide-topography of the Franciscan Complex. The eastern border is characterized by strike-ridges and valleys in Upper Mesozoic strata.  In several areas, Franciscan rocks are overlain by volcanic cones and flows of the Quien Sabe, Sonoma and Clear Lake volcanic fields. The Coast Ranges are subparallel to the active San Andreas Fault.  The San Andreas is more than 600 miles long, extending from Pt. Arena to the Gulf of California.  West of the San Andreas is the Salinian Block, a granitic core extending from the southern extremity of the Coast Ranges to the north of the Farallon Islands. 
Based on information obtained from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped with several soil types, including Corducci and Typic Xerofluvents, 0 to 5 percent slopes, occasionally flooded, MLRA 14 (300), Santa Ynez gravelly fine sandy loam, 2 to 9 percent slopes (SnC), Mocho sandy loam, overflow (Mr), and Camarillo very fine sandy loam (Cc). 

The Phase One Group 12 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
5.1.1.3 Hydrology 
According to California’s Groundwater: Bulletin 118, published by the State of California Department of Water Resources, the subject property is located in the Central Coast Hydrologic Region, Santa Ynez River Valley Groundwater Basin. The Santa Ynez River Valley Groundwater Basin is bounded by the Purisima Hills on the northwest, the San Rafael Mountains on the northeast, the Santa Ynez Mountains on the south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west. On the east and underlying the groundwater basin, the basin is bounded by consolidated nonwater-bearing rocks of Tertiary age (Wilson 1959). The Santa Ynez River, which rises in Juncal Canyon, follows a westward course for about 70 miles through the valley before flowing into the Pacific Ocean. Precipitation across the valley ranges from 15 to 21 inches, with an average of 17 inches. 
The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Santa Ynez River, located adjacent to the southwest side of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed at the subject property during this assessment. 
According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Buellton Water System serves the subject property vicinity.  According to a representative of the City of Buellton Water System, shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Buellton Water System are from four groundwater wells (Buellton Uplands and Santa Ynez River Underflow) and is supplemented by the State Water Project (from Northern California via aqueduct). 
According to environmental documentation posted on the State Water Resources Control Board, GeoTracker website (http://geotracker.swrcb.ca.gov), the depth and direction of groundwater in the vicinity of the subject property is inferred to be present at approximately 30 to 40 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flow toward the west-northwest. 
5.1.2 Historical Use Information 
5.1.2.1 Prior Uses of Property 
Based on a review of historical sources, the northeastern portion of the subject property appeared to be improved with a dwelling and developed for agricultural purposes as an orchard, and the remainder of the subject property appeared to be undeveloped from prior to 1928 until prior to 1938, when the existing barn was developed on the northeastern portion of the subject property and the subject property was reportedly used as a dairy farm, identified as the Willemsen Dairy. By 1943, additional farm-related structures and development were built on the northeastern portion of the subject property and by 1954 the southwestern portion of the subject property appeared to be used for pastureland as part of the dairy farm. By 1969, a retention basin appeared to be developed on the southeastern portion of the subject property, and by 1973, the southwestern 

The Phase One Group 13 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
portion of the subject property appeared to be developed for agricultural purposes. The subject property reportedly continued to be used as a dairy farm and for agricultural purposes until 1996, when the dairy farm ceased operations and the existing dwelling was developed on the northeastern portion of the subject property. The existing barn was reportedly refurbished and improved with a workshop, kitchen and a loft studio apartment.  In addition, the existing maintenance shop was built on-site, and subsequently developed with two storage sheds. At the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit, the subject property was in the process of being vacated to be sold. 
The subject property was historically used as a dairy farm operation.  It is unknown where wastewater discharge generated from the former dairy farm operation was directed to at the subject property.  The subject property soils in the area of the former dairy farm operation due to wastewater discharge may contain excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals.  Based on the above, the former dairy farm operation represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 
A retention basin appeared to be located on the southeastern portion of the subject property on the historical aerial photographs dated 1969, 1973, 1978 and 1981. The retention basin was no longer on-site at the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit.  The subject property soils in the area of the retention basin may contain agricultural related chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, along with excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals.  The subject property soils within the former retention basin location represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 
The northeastern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes as an orchard on the historical aerial photograph dated 1928, and the southwestern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes on the historical aerial photographs dated 1973, 1978 and 1981. There is a potential that agricultural related chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers may have been used at the subject property. Based on the above, the former agricultural use at the subject property represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 
5.1.2.2 Recorded Land Title Records 
Environmental liens recorded against the subject property were not reported to The Phase One Group. 
5.1.2.3 Chain of Title 
A 50-year chain-of-title was not requested for this study. Historical use of the subject property was researched using other standard historical sources.

Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) reportedly maintains ownership and operational responsibility for the transformers.  Based on the good condition of the equipment, the transformers are not expected to represent a significant environmental concern. 
No additional potential PCB-containing equipment (oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, etc.) was observed on the subject property. 
6.2.9 Sumps, Drywells, Catchbasins or Clarifiers 
No evidence of sumps, drywells, catchbasins or clarifiers was found on the subject property.  
A retention basin appeared to be located on the southeastern portion of the subject property on the historical aerial photographs dated 1969, 1973, 1978 and 1981. The retention basin was no longer on-site at the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit. The subject property soils in the area of the retention basin may contain agricultural related chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, along with excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals.  The subject property soils within the former retention basin location represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 
6.2.10 Pits, Ponds or Lagoons 
No evidence of pits, ponds or lagoons was observed at the subject property. 

The Phase One Group 31 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
6.2.11 Groundwater Wells 
The subject property is equipped with one irrigation groundwater well located on the southern portion of the subject property.  The irrigation groundwater well is reportedly not used for potable use as drinking water to the subject property is provided by the City of Buellton Water System.  No additional information regarding the on-site groundwater well was provided to The Phase One Group. 
6.2.12 Oil Wells/Pipelines 
No evidence of oil wells or pipelines was observed or reported at the subject property. 
One petroleum pipeline marker was observed off-site along the southwestern border of the subject property.  According to the marker, the petroleum pipeline is owned and operated by Plains Pipeline, L.P. No petroleum pipeline leaks were reported. 
6.2.13 Imported Fill 
No information related to the use of imported fill material was identified in records for the subject property. 
6.2.14 On-Site ASTs and USTs 
No evidence of underground storage tanks (USTs) was identified or reported during the site visit. 
An unlabeled 88-gallon capacity portable aboveground storage tank (AST) reportedly containing diesel fuel was observed stored outside along the southeastern border of the subject property, and an unlabeled 55-gallon capacity portable AST was stored outside along the southwestern side of the barn. 
Based on the subject property use as a former dairy farm operation, the possibility exists that the subject property is equipped with undocumented fuel underground storage tanks (USTs).  No evidence of on-site USTs was observed during the site visit. 
6.2.15 Radiological Hazards 
No evidence of radiological substances or equipment was stored on the subject property. 
6.2.16 Additional Hazard Observations 
No additional hazards were observed on the subject property. 
6.2.17 Asbestos 
Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to 

The Phase One Group 32 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  All thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building constructed prior to 1981 and have not been appropriately tested are “presumed asbestos-containing material” (PACM). 
The on-site dwelling was reportedly built in 1996 and the on-site barn was reportedly built prior to 1938. The Phase One Group has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACMs observed. Suspect ACMs observed at the subject property included wallboard/drywall and vinyl sheet flooring.  The suspect ACMs appeared to be in undamaged condition. 
The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site visit) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos.  This activity was not designed to discover all sources of suspect ACM, PACM, or asbestos at the subject property; or to comply with any regulations and/or laws relative to planned disturbance of building materials such as renovation or demolition, or any other regulatory purpose.  Rather, it is intended to give the User an indication if significant (significant due to quantity, accessibility, or condition) potential sources of ACM or PACM are present at the subject property.  Additional sampling, inspection, and evaluation will be warranted for any other use. 
The Phase One Group was not provided building plans or specifications for review, which may have been useful in determining areas likely to have used ACM. 
Based on the reported construction dates of the subject property buildings (prior to 1938 and 1996), a comprehensive ACM survey of construction materials at the subject property is recommended prior to any renovation or demolition activities to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. 
6.2.18 Lead-Based Paint 
Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body. LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Congress passed the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known as “Title X”, to protect families from exposure to lead from paint, dust, and soil.  Under Section 1017 of Title X, intact LBP on most walls and ceilings is not considered a “hazard,” although the condition of the paint should be monitored and maintained to ensure that it does not become deteriorated. Further, Section 1018 of this law directed the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US EPA to require the disclosure of known information on LBP and LBP hazards before the sale or lease of most housing built before 1978. 
The on-site barn was built prior to 1938.  Based on the age of the on-site barn (pre-1978), there is a potential that lead-based paint (LBP) is present.  Interior and exterior painted surfaces were observed in undamaged condition.  Actual material samples would need to be collected in order to determine if LBP is present.

6.2.19 Radon 
Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert and gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms. The USEPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones; Zone 1 being those areas with the average predicted indoor radon concentration in residential dwellings exceeding the US EPA Action Limit of 4.0 picoCuries per Liter (pCi/L). It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location.  However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. 
Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 1, where average predicted radon levels are above 4.0 pCi/L. However, based upon the reported proposed commercial use of the subject property, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern. 
6.2.20 Water Intrusion and Mold Growth 
The Phase One Group performed a limited visual inspection for the conspicuous presence of mold in the subject property buildings.  The Phase One Group inspected the accessible interior areas of the subject property building, including walls and ceilings, common mechanical/electrical closets, areas under sinks and around windows and exterior doors for the presence of conspicuous mold or observed water intrusion or accumulation. 
The Phase One Group did not note conspicuous visual or olfactory indications of the presence of mold, nor did The Phase One Group observe obvious indications of significant water damage at the time of the inspection (in the areas inspected). No sampling was conducted as part of this assessment. 
This activity was not designed to discover all areas, which may be affected by mold growth on the subject property.  Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) mold growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, HVAC systems (if present), areas behind enclosed walls, attics, crawl spaces, ceilings or other areas that were difficult to access.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
7.1 CONCLUSIONS 
The Phase One Group has performed a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard E1527-13 of the Residential/Agricultural Property located at 202 Dairyland Road, in the City of Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 (the “subject property”). Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 2.0 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions (RECs), historical recognized environmental conditions (HRECs), or controlled recognized environmental conditions (CRECs) in connection with the subject property, except for the following: 
• 
At the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit, an area of stained soil and gravel approximately eight feet by eight feet in size was observed within the on-site maintenance shop building.  The stained soil and gravel represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 

• 
The subject property was historically used as a dairy farm operation.  It is unknown where wastewater discharge generated from the former dairy farm operation was directed to at the subject property. The subject property soils in the area of the former dairy farm operation due to wastewater discharge may contain excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals.  Based on the above, the former dairy farm operation represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 

• 
A retention basin appeared to be located on the southeastern portion of the subject property on the historical aerial photographs dated 1969, 1973, 1978 and 1981. The retention basin was no longer on-site at the time of The Phase One Group’s site visit.  The subject property soils in the area of the retention basin may contain agricultural related chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, along with excessive quantities of nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, antibiotics and waste pathogens (fecal coliform and streptococci) and/or heavy metals. The subject property soils within the former retention basin location represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 

• 
The northeastern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes as an orchard on the historical aerial photograph dated 1928, and the southwestern portion of the subject property appears to be developed for agricultural purposes on the historical aerial photographs dated 1973, 1978 and 1981. There is a potential that agricultural related chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers may have been used at the subject property. Based on the above, the former agricultural use at the subject property represents a recognized environmental condition (REC) in connection with the subject property. 



The Phase One Group 36 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by The Phase One Group, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion. The following environmental issues were identified during the course of this assessment: 
• 
An unlabeled 88-gallon capacity portable aboveground storage tank (AST) reportedly containing diesel fuel was observed stored outside along the southeastern border of the subject property, an unlabeled 55-gallon capacity portable AST stored outside along the southwestern side of the barn, and numerous pails and containers of hydraulic oil, lubricants and maintenance chemicals were observed stored outside adjacent to maintenance shop. No evidence of leaks or staining was observed in the areas of the ASTs and containers of hydraulic oil, lubricants and maintenance chemicals. 

• 
Based on the subject property use as a former dairy farm operation, the possibility exists that the subject property is equipped with undocumented fuel underground storage tanks (USTs).  No evidence of on-site USTs was observed during the site visit. 

• 
Although no evidence was identified during the site visit, historical on-site septic systems associated with the former on-site structures may be present on-site. 

• 
The subject property is equipped with one irrigation groundwater well located on the southern portion of the subject property.  The irrigation groundwater well is reportedly not used for potable use as drinking water to the subject property is provided by the City of Buellton Water System.  No additional information regarding the on-site groundwater well was provided to The Phase One Group. 


7.2 RECOMMENDATIONS 
As a result of this assessment, The Phase One Group recommends the following: 
• 
A limited subsurface investigation should be conducted at the subject property in order to determine the presence or absence of soil and/or groundwater contamination due to the former dairy farm operation and agricultural use, including the location of the former retention basin. 

• 
A limited subsurface investigation should be conducted in the area of oil-stained soil and gravel within the maintenance shop building. 

• 
The observed unlabeled 88-gallon capacity portable aboveground storage tank (AST) reportedly containing diesel fuel was observed stored outside along the southeastern border of the subject property, an unlabeled 55-gallon capacity portable AST stored outside along the southwestern side of the barn, and numerous pails and containers of hydraulic oil, lubricants and maintenance chemicals should be collected and properly disposed of by a certified hazardous waste hauler. 



The Phase One Group 37 202 Dairyland Road Buellton, Santa Barbara County, California 93427 Project Number: 20-012 
• 
If on-site USTs are identified during redevelopment activities of the subject property, the USTs should be properly closed and removed following current regulatory procedures and guidelines. 

• 
If historical on-site septic systems are identified during redevelopment activities of the subject property, the historical on-site septic systems should be properly closed and removed following current regulatory procedures and guidelines. 

• 
If no longer in use, the irrigation groundwater well on the southern portion of the subject property should be properly decommissioned and closed utilizing current regulatory standards and procedures.
