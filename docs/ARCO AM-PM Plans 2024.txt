Resiliency. Detectable warning surfaces shall differ from adjoining surfaces in resiliency or sound-on-cane contact. Curb ramps. Detectable warnings at curb ramps shall extend 36 inches (914 mm) in the direction of travel. Detectable warnings shall extend the full width of the ramp run less 2 inches (51
