376 Ave of Flags Mixed-Use Project (Pea Soup Andersen's site)
Planning Projects
The site of an iconic Buellton restaurant, which closed in 2024, has been purchased, and a concept has been submitted for redevelopment. This is only a submitted concept and there is a substantial process before anything will be built on the site.
The proposed project envisions a mixed-use building with commercial spaces on the ground floor along the street frontages and residential units on the upper floor. The plan includes 125 for-sale condominium units, offering a mix of one-bedroom and one-bedroom-plus-den layouts. Commercial components feature a 4,595-square-foot restaurant (Andersen's), a 6,800-square-foot office space, and a 5,734-square-foot gym. The restaurant and office will be located at the intersection of Highway 246 and Avenue of Flags, where a large plaza is also planned. The gym will be situated at the north end of the building along Avenue of Flags. The structure is designed around a large central courtyard, divided into two spaces. Residential units will also occupy portions of the ground floor surrounding the courtyard. One of the courtyard spaces is expected to include a pool, while the other will feature passive recreational amenities such as a flexible lawn, BBQ station, fire pits, and more. The Avenue of Flags Specific Plan mandates Art Deco architecture for the project. Additionally, the City Council will review the plans for appropriate measures to mitigate the loss of a historic resource and ways to permanently acknowledge and recognize the site's significance to the community.
